before you use the Software

This Software License Agreement (the "Agreement") is a legally binding
agreement between the User of the software (the "User") and SIGASI nv
("SIGASI"), seated at Kerkstraat 108, 9050 Gentbrugge, Belgium. By using,
installing or clicking the acceptance button of the software (as updated by
SIGASI from time to time, the "Software"), the User is accepting to be bound
by all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

1. Grant of License. 

The Software and all accompanying documentation (the
"Documentation") are licensed to the User, under the terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement. Subject to such terms and conditions
SIGASI hereby grants to the User a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use
the Software and the Documentation and to the extent permitted by
payment of applicable license fees, if any, under an approved
licensing model and/or a Software License Key. Depending upon the
model utilized to compute the applicable license fees paid by the User
to use the Software (whether per Processor, per user, or any other
approved licensing model), an applicable Software License Key may
limit usage of the Software accordingly. The User may use the Software
on a single computer (node-locked license or floating licensing)
located in a country to which the Software is legally exported. The
software may not be exported or re-exported to certain countries or
to persons or entities prohibited from receiving U.S. exports
(including those (a) on the Bureau of Industry and Security Denied
Parties List or Entity List, (b) on the Office of Foreign Assets
Control list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons,
and (c) involved with missile technology or nuclear, chemical or
biological weapons).

2. Limitations on Use. 

The User will not modify or translate the Software or
the Documentation without the prior written consent of SIGASI. The User will
not reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or otherwise attempt to recreate
the source code of the Software. The User will not separate from the Software
any of the component parts of the Software.

3. Limitations on Duplication. 

The User may not make any copies of the Software or the Documentation, provided, 
however, that the User may make a reasonable number of copies of the Software or 
the Documentation solely for backup or archival purposes if such copy of 
the Software or Documentation contains the notation "Copyright 
SIGASI". The User will not print any on-line or electronic documentation other 
than solely for servicing, operating or training purposes.The User may 
not remove any titles, trademarks or trade names, copyright notices, 
or other proprietary markings on the Software. SIGASI retains all 
rights not expressly granted to the User under this Agreement.

4. Limitations on Transfer. 

The User will not sell, rent, lease or otherwise
transfer any or all of the Software, the Documentation or any copies thereof,
without the prior written consent of SIGASI. The User will not sublicense,
assign, delegate, rent, lease or otherwise transfer any or all of its rights
under this Agreement to any third party.

5. Ownership and Copyright. 

The User has not acquired, by virtue of thisAgreement, any right of ownership 
in or to the Software, the Documentation or any related patent, copyright, 
trademark or other intellectual property right.
By virtue of this Agreement, the User has acquired a right of ownership solely
in and to the physical media on which the Software and the Documentation are
recorded or fixed. SIGASI, its licensors and their respective licensors retain
all right, title and interest in and to the Software, the Documentation and
any and all copies thereof, except for the rights expressly granted to the
User pursuant to this Agreement and as may be granted by SIGASI from time to
time. Such right, title and interest of SIGASI is, and such right, title and
interest of SIGASI's licensors and their respective licensors may be protected
by applicable copyright laws and international treaties.

6. Term and Termination. 

This Agreement remains effective until expiration or termination. This
Agreement will immediately terminate upon notice if the User exceeds
the scope of license granted. For any other material breach under this
Agreement, SIGASI may terminate this Agreement upon 30 days written
notice if the User is in material breach and fails to cure such breach
within the 30 day notice period. If a Software license was provided
for limited term use, such license will automatically terminate at the
end of the authorized term. The agreement shall be extended in case of
timely payment of the license fees by the User. 

If the User fails to comply with any of the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, then (a) this Agreement will automatically terminate,
(b) notwithstanding such termination, the User will (i) destroy or permanently
erase the Software and any and all copies thereof and (ii) destroy the
Documentation and any and all copies thereof, and (c) SIGASI may exercise any
or all remedies available to it under applicable laws. In addition, the User
may terminate this Agreement at any time by (a) destroying or permanently
erasing the Software and any and all copies thereof and (b) destroying the
Documentation and any and all copies thereof. In case the User
terminates this Agreement, SIGASI shall not refund any license fees
paid by the User partially or totally. 

7. Support. 

SIGASI may offer support for installing, maintaining and operating
the Software, at its own discretion and on a best-effort basis. The User
thereto can contact SIGASI via the support pages at http://www.sigasi.com.

8. Debug and usage information.

The Software can at certain intervals contact an online service, operated
by SIGASI. The Software can transmit certain debug information and usage
information to such service, subject to approval of the User. SIGASI
will only use such information for the purpose of improving its
products and for future product planning. The User will be able to
inspect which information is being sent and will be able to cancel the
transmission. SIGASI will not disclose such information, unless in a
sufficiently aggregated and anonymized form. 

9. NO WARRANTIES( LIMITED WARRANTY). 

Sigasi declares it has all rights to enter into this agreement. 
THE SOFTWARE IS MADE AVAILABLE TO THE USER ON AN "AS IS" BASIS WITHOUT
ANY EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING
WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. 
Some jurisdictions may not permit the exclusion of implied warranties; so the
above exclusion may not apply to the User. The User may have other rights that
vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. If during the evaluation
period the Software does not substantially conform to the description
contained in the applicable end user documentation, the Users’ sole
remedy will be that Sigasi shall refund the license fees paid, if any,
related to the Software provided that (a) the Software has been
properly installed and used at all times an in accordance with the
instructions in the applicable end user documentation (b) no
modification, alteration or addition has been made to the Software
product by persons other than Sigasi and (c) Sigasi receives written
notice of the non-conformity within 30 days (following shipment of the
first Software License Key). SIGASI may from time to time, in its sole
discretion, make available to the User, without charge, updates to the 
Software or the Documentation. No such action will create any warranty 
obligation on the part of SIGASI

10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. 

IN NO EVENT WILL SIGASI, ITS DISTRIBUTORS
, ITS LICENSORS, OR THEIR RESPECTIVE LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY
DAMAGES OR OTHER RELIEF WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF USER'S USE OR
INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE OR THE DOCUMENTATION, INCLUDING WITHOUT
LIMITATION LOST PROFITS, LOST BUSINESS OR LOST OPPORTUNITY OR ANY
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES OR LEGAL
FEES ARISING OUT OF SUCH USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF
SIGASI, ITS DISTRIBUTORS, ITS LICENSORS OR THEIR RESPECTIVE LICENSORS
HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
Some jurisdictions may not permit the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
consequential damages; so the above exclusion or limitation may not apply to
the User. SIGASI, its distributors and licensors’ liability under this
Agreement will not, in any event, exceed the license fees, if any,
paid by the User for the Software licensed under this Agreement. In
case an electronic circuit designed using the SIGASI software does
not function properly, SIGASI will not be responsible thereof. The
User must validate the code and the electronic circuit in accordance
with the industrial standards.
