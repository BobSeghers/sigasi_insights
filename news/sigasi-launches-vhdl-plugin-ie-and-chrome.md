<h2>Web development becomes available to those trained in <span class="caps">VHDL</span> design.</h2>	<p><em>San Jose &#8211; April 1, 2012</em> &#8211; Electronic Design Automation company Sigasi announces the release of a <span class="caps">VHDL</span> plugin for popular web browsers Internet Explorer and Google Chrome. Much like JavaScript capabilities, this plugin will allow <span class="caps">VHDL</span> scipts to run inside the IE and Chrome webbrowsers. </p>	<p>&#8220;We have long felt a market demand for <span class="caps">VHDL</span> support in web pages,&#8221; says Sigasi <span class="caps">CEO</span> Philippe Faes. &#8220;Many hardware designers want to make interactive web pages, but have no knowledge of the popular scripting languages like JavaScript. This plugin will allow them to create high-quality interactive websites with the language they are most familiar with.&#8221; </p>	<p>&#8220;The first Apps for our <span class="caps">VHDL</span> plugin are already available,&#8221; says Sigasi <span class="caps">CTO</span> Hendrik Eeckhaut. &#8220;Two of our partners have developped a calendar application and a to-do list, written completely in <span class="caps">VHDL</span>.&#8221;</p>	<p><span class="caps">VHDL</span> designers who want to build interactive websites, are invited to <a href="http://www.sigasi.com/content/vhdl-plugin-ie-chrome">download the <span class="caps">VHDL</span> plugin for IE and Chrome here</a>.</p>  </div>
