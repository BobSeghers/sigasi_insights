Under this <strong>Sigasi Labs</strong> label, we will share new features, before they are commercially ready. Users will be able to experience the newest technology and help direct how new features evolve. This month's product release will contain the first Sigasi Labs feature.</p><p>We have some nice pieces of VHDL technology that are not quite ready yet to be part of our commercial offering. This can have many causes: the human interface is not intuitive enough, there are not enough configuration options, the user messages are still a bit cryptic, or we just don't know yet how to market the new feature.</p><p>Still, we know that many of our customers and student users would like to get their hands on these features sooner rather than later. For that reason, we have decided to release these features under the <strong>Sigasi Labs</strong> label. <strong>Sigasi Labs</strong> means that you get to use new stuff sooner, but we can offer less guarantees. Things might break. Or, in upcoming releases, Labs features might significantly change or even disappear. </p><p>As <a href="http://www.googlelabs.com/faq" class="elf-external elf-icon">Google</a> puts it: <em>Labs is our playground. We try to keep it safe and orderly, but still keep it informal and, above all, fun.</em> Sigasi Labs features will be clearly marked with an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlenmeyer_flask" class="elf-external elf-icon">Erlenmeyer flask</a> icon. This makes it easy for people who choose not to use any labs features.</p><p>Sigasi Labs is a way for us to share what we have in our development pipeline. It is also an opportunity for you to help shape the <em>future of VHDL design</em>. Your input will be most appreciated and important for deciding how to improve and build new features.</p>  </div>
