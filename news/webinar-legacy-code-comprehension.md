<p>Everybody runs in to legacy code. Code that is not written by yourself or by your own team. Code that uses different conventions for filenames and directory structures. Code that contains broken files and code without build scripts. Nobody likes legacy code, but sometimes you have to dig through it. At the start of a new project that builds on old stuff, or when you are interfacing with a third-party IP core. You need to understand (or even change) the old code. Traditional ways of inspecting legacy code involve reading a lot of files and using search tools such as <code>grep</code>.</p>	<p>In this webinar, we will show you how to quickly grasp the basic structure of a legacy project. You will learn how to get to the structure and function of <span class="caps">VHDL</span> code in a matter of hours, rather than days.</p>	<p>When: Tuesday, March 13th, 2012 at 11am <span class="caps">CET</span>. <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20120313T11&amp;p1=1246" class="elf-external elf-icon">2012-03-13 11:00 +0100</a><br/><a href="https://sigasi.webex.com/sigasi/j.php?ED=5543737&amp;RG=1&amp;UID=28914107&amp;RT=MiMyMw%3D%3D" class="elf-external elf-icon">Register here</a> for the webinar.</p>  </div>
