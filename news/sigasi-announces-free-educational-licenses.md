This means that students and professors are free to use Sigasi HDT for teaching and learning VHDL design.</p><p>In the last half year We have granted free student licenses for our VHDL development environment. However, We had not announced this widely until now. Still, students and professors from over <em>fifty</em> universities, schools and colleges in over <em>twenty countries</em> are currently using a Sigasi HDT educational license.</p><p>Today, we want to reach out to the entire academic community. Teachers can use Sigasi HDT in their classrooms. Students can run Sigasi HDT on their own laptops for completing assignments. Signing up for an educational license is easy. Just <a href="/start-edu">sign up</a> with your name and your college e-mail address. Don't forget to indicate whether you are a student or a teacher.</p><p>If you are using Sigasi software in your college, it would be great if you can <a href="/forums/general-discussion">tell us</a> about your experience. If you are attending FPL, please do come and visit the Sigasi booth!</p><p>Enjoy!</p><p>-- Philippe</p>  </div>
