This week, the regional government of Flanders, Belgium granted funding to Sigasi. The extra funding will leverage the initial investment by the founders. Sigasi is proud that its business project has been found worthy of funding, and will continue to develop its business and its technology over the course of 2008. The two goals for this year are first to demonstrate our technology and second to find seed funding needed for developing a stable product.   </div>
