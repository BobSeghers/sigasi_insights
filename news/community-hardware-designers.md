<div class="content">
<p>Many of you may have heard of <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com" title="www.stackoverflow.com" class="elf-external elf-icon">www.stackoverflow.com</a>. This is an online community of software engineers answering each other's questions. There are some discussions about VHDL and FPGAs, but most content on this website is about software engineering.</p><p>Some people, including myself, think that it's time to have a home for hardware engineers. Jakob Eriksson has started a new site, <a href="http://www.overmapped.com" title="www.overmapped.com" class="elf-external elf-icon">www.overmapped.com</a> based on the same principles as stackoverflow, but using a different infrastructure to build it. There has been <a href="http://www.overmapped.com/questions/can-a-stackexchange-site-better-serve-the-community" class="elf-external elf-icon">some discussion</a> about the future for the stackoverflow community. The general consensus seems to be that we want to move to the StackExchange platform (on which stackoverflow is built). Main reason is that we can have more confidence in the continuity of the site if it is managed by StackExchange.</p><p>But in order to move, we need to demonstrate that <em>enough people</em> are interested in this community. <strong>Therefor, please go and <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/20632/programmable-logic-and-fpga-design" class="elf-external elf-icon">vote for this proposal</a></strong>, and (as Martin points out in the comments) vote on on-topic and off-topic questions and add your own! </p><p>While we are waiting for the new site to be approved, keep posting your questions and answers at <a href="http://www.overmapped.com" title="www.overmapped.com" class="elf-external elf-icon">www.overmapped.com</a>. This way we can all help each other be better engineers.</p>  </div>
