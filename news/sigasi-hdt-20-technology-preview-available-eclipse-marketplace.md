<div class="content">
<p>The <a href="/panel/sigasi_2_0">Sigasi HDT 2.0 Technology Preview</a> is now available in the Eclipse Marketplace. So you can now also try it on Mac Os X.</p><p><span class="inline inline-center"><img src="http://www.sigasi.com/sites/www.sigasi.com/files/images/MarketPlace.png" alt="" title="" class="image image-_original " width="560" height="506"/></span></p><p>The installation is very similar to the <a href="http://localhost/install_plugin_36" class="elf-external elf-icon">Eclipse plugin installation procedure of HDT 1.0</a>. Just select <strong>Sigasi HDT 2.0 Technology Preview</strong> instead.</p><p>Let know what you think.<br/>Hendrik.</p><p>Notes:</p><ul><li> We only tested this install procedure for Eclipse 3.6.2 (Windows, Linux and Mac).</li><li> Currently the HDT 2.0 plugin has a dependency on JDT (Java Development Toolkit). So installing HDT 2.0 will also install Java tooling in your Eclipse. This dependency will be removed in the stabel release.</li></ul>  </div>
