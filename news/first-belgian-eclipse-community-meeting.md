<p>Yesterday I went to <a href="http://www.collibra.com/" class="elf-external elf-icon">Collibra</a> in Brussels to attend the first <a href="http://www.sigasi.com/node/25">Belgian Eclipse Community meeting</a>. It was a very interesting evening and lots of good ideas were exchanged.</p><p>There was a relatively high attendance despite the late announcement. All persons present were young starters; It always feels good to be around enthusiastic people.</p><p>After we all presented our use of Eclipse, we discussed how we will take on future meetings. There is certainly no lack of good ideas and interesting subjects.</p><p>All Belgian Eclipse Community related information will be collected on a dedicated <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Regional_Communities/Belgium" class="elf-external elf-icon">wiki page</a> on wiki.eclipse.org. We also started a mailing list <a href="https://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/belgium-ec" class="elf-external elf-icon">belgium-ec</a>.</p><p>For our next meeting (April 28th at <a href="http://www.inventivedesigners.com/corporate/route.html" class="elf-external elf-icon">Inventive Designers</a>) we should find more Belgian eclipse developers to join us and work on a broader member base.</p><p>Thanks to Felix and Damien for hosting this nice event.</p>  </div>
