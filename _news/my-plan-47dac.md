<p>As I blogged earlier, together with Sigasi's CEO, Philippe Faes, I will be <a href="/content/sigasi-going-47dac">traveling to #47DAC</a> soon.<br/>I hope I can cope with the jetlag because I expect really intesive days...</p><p>We arrive late on Sunday evening so I will unfortunately miss the first networking opportunity at the <a href="http://www2.dac.com/kick_off+reception.aspx" class="elf-external elf-icon">opening reception</a>.</p><h2>Monday</h2><p>Monday morning I have to remember to fetch my <a href="http://www.denali.com/wordpress/index.php/dmr/2010/05/18/party-on-at-dac-says-denali" class="elf-external elf-icon">tickets for the Denali party</a>. I'm told this is <em>the</em> place to be at DAC.</p><p>Then to the Boot #694 for Gary Smith's review of <a href="http://www2.dac.com/panels.aspx?event=97&amp;topic=13" class="elf-external elf-icon">EDA's hottest technology trends</a>. Now is probably a bit late to pitch to Gary, but I should tackle him to make sure he mentions Sigasi as extremely hot next year. </p><p>Next I plan to visit the <em>IC Design Central</em> for a talk about an <a href="http://www2.dac.com/ic+design+central.aspx?event=87&amp;topic=10" class="elf-external elf-icon">Eclipse based IDE for e and SystemVerilog</a>. I'm sure the speakers will agree with our <a href="http://www.sigasi.com/content/why-hardware-designers-should-switch-eclipse">vision on Eclipse in EDA</a>.</p><p>Monday afternoon I will finaly meet Michael Keating in person. I'm eager to discuss his vision on hardware design and refactoring. I will also try to talk him into posting new content on his blog on <a href="http://synopsysoc.org/futureofdesign/" class="elf-external elf-icon">the future of design</a>.</p><p>If I can obain a ticket, I'll be at the Denali party Monday evening. The <a href="https://www.denali.com/en/events/register/eda_idol.jsp" class="elf-external elf-icon">Denali website</a> says I'm too late to register for the EDA idol competition. I suppose that is the best for everybody.</p><h2>Tuesday</h2><p>The <a href="http://www2.dac.com/keynotes.aspx?event=121&amp;topic=2" class="elf-external elf-icon">keynote</a> seems less interesting for me, so possibily I'll try to get some extra sleep before I head to the panel discussion about <a href="http://www2.dac.com/panels.aspx?event=48&amp;topic=13" class="elf-external elf-icon">EDA Challenges and Options: Investing for the Future</a>.<br/>I'm also curious to hear the different viewpoints in the <a href="http://www2.dac.com/panels.aspx?event=68&amp;topic=9" class="elf-external elf-icon">Is the FPGA Tool Opportunity an Oasis or a Mirage?</a> discusion. Kevin Morris of <a href="http://www.fpgajournal.com/" class="elf-external elf-icon">FPGA Journal</a> will be chairing this session, so I expect an animated discussion.</p><p>Of course I will also need a lot of time to visit a lot of interesting booths at the <a href="http://www2.dac.com/who_s+exhibiting.aspx" class="elf-external elf-icon">exibition</a>: <a href="http://agnisys.us/" class="elf-external elf-icon">Agnisys</a>, <a href="http://www.asicanalytic.com/" class="elf-external elf-icon">ASIC Analytic</a>, <a href="http://www.gaterocket.com" class="elf-external elf-icon">GateRocket</a>, <a href="http://www.hipeac.net/" class="elf-external elf-icon">HiPEAC</a>, <a href="http://www.interrasystems.com/" class="elf-external elf-icon">Interra Systems</a>, <a href="http://www.mephisto-da.com/" class="elf-external elf-icon">Mephisto DA</a> and many more...</p><h2>Wednesday</h2><p>On Wednesday Lucio Lanza will share his opinion on Sigasi's plan in the <a href="http://www2.dac.com/panels.aspx?event=101&amp;topic=2" class="elf-external elf-icon">Lucio's Litmus Test: Is Your Start-Up Ready for the 21st Century?</a> session. Make sure you are at Booth #694 at 9:15 AM, if you want to hear Philippe pitching our vision and strategy.</p><p>In the afternoon I plan to attend the <a href="http://www2.dac.com/panels.aspx?event=127&amp;topic=2" class="elf-external elf-icon">Does IC Design Have a Future in the Clouds?</a>. Because of our victory in the <a href="http://www.xuropa.com/blog/2010/05/11/and-the-do-more-with-less-winner-is/" class="elf-external elf-icon">Xuropa competition</a>, Sigasi will also be available in <em>the cloud</em> soon.</p><p>In the late evening we travel to San Jose to meet even more people.</p><p>Interesting times ahead!<br/>Hendrik.</p>  </div>
