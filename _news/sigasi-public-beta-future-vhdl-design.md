<p>Today, Sigasi proudly announces the Public Beta program for Sigasi HDT, an Intelligent Development Environment (IDE) for VHDL (<a href="http://www.sigasi.com/publicbeta" title="http://www.sigasi.com/publicbeta">http://www.sigasi.com/publicbeta</a>).</p><p>Sigasi HDT (Hardware Development Toolkit) is a powerful VHDL development tool that assists designers in reading, writing and modifying VHDL more accurately and faster. It differs from other development tools in that it contains an ultra-fast VHDL parser and compiler that runs transparently in the background (<a href="http://www.sigasi.com/product" title="http://www.sigasi.com/product">http://www.sigasi.com/product</a>).</p><p>Through the Public Beta program, VHDL designers join a community that takes advantage of modern development techniques.
