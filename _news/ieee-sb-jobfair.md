On Tuesday, Sigasi will participate in the first <a href="http://www.ieeesb.ugent.be/jobfair">jobfair</a> of the IEEE student branch Gent. Since the Sigasi team currently consists only of its founders, the title of "Sigasi Employee No 1" is still available. Near the end of 2008 and in the course of 2009, Sigasi will recruit software design engineers. Anyone interested is invited to show up at the jobfair, or to <a href="mailto:info@sigasi.com">contact us</a> directly.  </div>
