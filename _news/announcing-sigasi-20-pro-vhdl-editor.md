<p><em>Editorial Contact:</em><br/><em>Philippe Faes, <span class="caps">CEO</span> Sigasi</em><br/><em>T: +32 9 265 71 38</em><br/><a href="mailto:philippe.faes@sigasi.com" class="elf-mailto elf-icon"><em>philippe.faes@sigasi.com</em></a></p>	<h3><span class="caps">EDA</span> startup Sigasi launches the second version of its popular <span class="caps">VHDL</span> editor. </h3>	<p><strong>San Jose, CA / Ghent, Belgium &#8211; October 5, 2011</strong> Today, Sigasi launched a new version of our <span class="caps">VHDL</span> entry and inspection tool: Sigasi 2.0 Pro. The break-through feature in this release is type-time compile. This means that the code gets analysed while the engineer is typing. Info markers and error messages appear on the spot. Much like with a word processor&#8217;s spell checker, the designer gets instant feedback, making him more productive.</p>	<p>The differentiating feature of Sigasi&#8217;s products is that they enable project-based editing. The editor is aware of all of the design files in the project, supporting features such as cross-file navigation, smart content assist and semantic highlighting. Using project-wide knowledge, Sigasi helps engineers manage complex hardware designs. Type-time compilation makes this feature set even stronger.</p>	<p><strong>Acknowledgment</strong> Part of the Sigasi research is funded by <a href="http://www.iwt.be" class="elf-external elf-icon"><span class="caps">IWT</span></a></p>  </div>
