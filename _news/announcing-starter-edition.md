<h2>Starter Edition</h2>	<p>In the past two years, thousands of hardware designers have worked with the Sigasi <span class="caps">HDT</span> 1.0 development tool for <span class="caps">VHDL</span>. Today, is the time for something newer and better. We are releasing the <a href="/sigasi-20">Sigasi 2.0, Starter Edition</a>. Our Starter Edition is designed to beat any existing <em><span class="caps">VHDL</span> editor</em> in usability and functionality. Even better: if your design is <a href="/faq/what-small-project">small enough</a> you get the <a href="/sigasi-20-feature-matrix">full functionality</a> of the <a href="/sigasi-20-pro">upcoming Sigasi 2.0</a>, for free. That includes rename refactorings, mouse-over hovers, as-you-type error markers and project navigation. </p>	<p><span class="inline inline-center"><img src="http://www.sigasi.com/sites/www.sigasi.com/files/images/starter_s.img_assist_custom-595x396.jpg" alt="Starter Edition" title="Starter Edition" class="image image-img_assist_custom-595x396 " width="595" height="396"/><span class="caption"><strong>Starter Edition</strong></span></span></p>	<h2>What's the Catch?</h2>	<p>Why are we giving away stuff for free? In fact we're not. You are paying us back in two ways: first, the Starter Edition will ask you to send debug and profile information back to Sigasi. You will be able to inspect the data that gets sent back to us to ensure confidentiality. Getting debug info (stack dumps) back from a large user base is important because it helps in making a better tool. Second, you are invited to participate in discussions on our website.</p>	<p>Both the debug info and the participation in online discussions help shape the Sigasi 2.0 product. In the end, everybody benefits because (as promised) the Starter Edition will remain free forever.</p>	<p>Of course, if you love the Starter Edition so much, you can always upgrade to the Pro Edition, which will launch later this year.</p>	<p>So please, try it out!</p>	<h2>Go and <a href="/download-sigasi-20">download Sigasi 2.0 Starter Edition</a>. </h2>  </div>
