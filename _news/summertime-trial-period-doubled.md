<p>It's summertime and things in this part of the world are slowing down. This is an excellent time to <em>try out some new tooling</em>. </p><p>We are taking a closer look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)" class="elf-external elf-icon">Git</a>, <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/" class="elf-external elf-icon">Scala</a> and some other cool stuff.</p><p>At the same time, we have extended our trial period from 2 weeks to 4 weeks. Existing users who&#180;s license has expired can request a <a href="/request-extra-evaluation">new evaluation license</a>. If you are new to Sigasi, you can subscribe for a free trial and take an entire month to see how Sigasi HDT works on your VHDL project. Give it a shot and let us know what you think.</p><p>-- Philippe</p>  </div>
