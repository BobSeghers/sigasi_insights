<p>We have been using <a href="http://www.highriseqh.com" class="elf-external elf-icon">Highrise</a> as a CRM system for over two years. It's not bad, but it is not completely what we need either. If you search Google for CRMs, you get 30 million results and I'm not going to evaluate 30 million CRM systems. Rather: three.</p><p>Instead of finding the perfect CRM needle in the haystack, I'll ask you and hope that somebody knows the perfect solution to my problem. I'll be very specific about what I want, but I'm also aware that I might have to make compromises.</p><ul><li>Hosted/SaaS: I don't want to install stuff on my server. It needs to run in the cloud.</li><li>Contact management: all the contact data from user that register on the website goes into the CRM</li><li>Link between each person and the company he works for. Even if we have to guess the company from the person's e-mail address.</li><li>Lead tracking: for all leads, I want to see statistics: how many times did he visit the website, post a question, send me an e-mail, click on link in a mail that we have sent?</li><li>Integration with <a href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com/" title="http://www.campaignmonitor.com/" class="elf-external elf-icon">http://www.campaignmonitor.com/</a> (or similar email marketing tool)</li><li>Price Quotes: easily generate price quotes, which are automatically emailed to the customer.</li><li>Invoices: same for invoices.</li><li>Follow-up for invoices: did the customer pay already?</li><li>Integrated management for software licenses: generate licenses, notifications when a license expires.</li><li/></ul><p>Obviously, we will need some integration with our existing infrastructure, but less custom logic is better. Oh, and did I mention that in an ideal world, all of this would be cheap?</p><p>-- Philippe</p>  </div>
