Instead of having a hardware design contest, Sigasi has a Lego building contest. We are handing out Lego bricks with the Sigasi logo <a href="/fpl2012">at <span class="caps">FPL</span> 2012 in Oslo</a>. If you have received a Sigasi Lego brick in some other way, you can participate too!.</p>	<ol><li><strong>Create a Lego construction</strong> with your Sigasi Lego bricks. You can team up with friends to have a bigger pile of bricks or you can add bricks from your own personal collection. As long as there is a Sigasi Lego brick in your construction.</li>		<li>Note: there is extra credit for geeky constructions!</li>		<li>Take a picture</li>		<li>Share your picture on either:	<ul><li>Facebook: Make sure to <a href="http://on.fb.me/sigasi" class="elf-external elf-icon">Like Sigasi</a> and post on the Sigasi wall</li>		<li>Twitter: Follow <a href="http://www.twitter.com/sigasi" class="elf-external elf-icon">@sigasi</a> and use the handle @sigasi in the tweet.</li>		<li>You could also e-mail, fax or use postal mail, but that subtracts from your geekiness.</li>	</ul></li>		<li>We will republish selected photo's on our website. If you're not OK with that, don't submit.</li>		<li>The winner will receive an BeMicro <span class="caps">FPGA</span> development board.</li>	</ol><p>The contest runs until the end of September 2012. We'll announce the winners in the first week of October.</p>	<p>If you don't have a "Sigasi" lego brick, you can <a href="http://sites.fastspring.com/sigasi/product/sibrick" class="elf-external elf-icon">order one here</a>. First ten people to use the coupon code <strong><span class="caps">SIGASIBRICK</span></strong> get their Lego bricks sent for free.</p>  </div>
