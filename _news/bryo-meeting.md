<p>This morning I attended a meeting of <a href="http://www.bryo.be" class="elf-external elf-icon">Bryo</a>, a group of young entrepreneurs. One of the most important things I get from these meetings is an entrepreneurial drive, a high that helps keep me going at least until the next meeting.</p><p>I hear similar experiences from other Bryo members. So to anyone out there thinking about starting their own business: you should go and look for like-minded people and meet with them regularly. This way you'll have someone to learn from and to teach to. It'll help you keep your spirits up.</p><p>One of today's speakers said this: You only have about twenty-five years to work on your business. In your twenties, you're still warming up, learning. Then when you're thirty, you really get going and by the time you are fifty-five or sixty, you're starting to take things slowly. So the time now. You only have a short twenty-five years.</p><p>Now, you may object to this statement, but I agree at least with the "time is now" bit. Anyway, <a href="http://www.sigasi.com/founders">Hendrik</a> and I both recently turned thirty, so we're ready to get our hands dirty!</p>  </div>
