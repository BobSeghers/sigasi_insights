<p>Hendrik and I are sitting at the Starbucks in front of gate B1 at Brussels Airport.</p><p>We're headed first for Chicago where we will have a speed meeting during our 6 hour overlay and after that, we're headed straight to Anaheim for the <a href="http://www.dac.com" class="elf-external elf-icon">Design Automation Conference</a>.</p><p><span class="inline inline-left"><img src="http://www.sigasi.com/sites/www.sigasi.com/files/images/photo.img_assist_custom-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="" class="image image-img_assist_custom-300x225 " width="300" height="225"/></span>As some of you know, Sigasi provides an intelligent development environment (IDE) for VHDL. Our IDE analyses your VHDL code right away and helps you read, write and modify even larges bodies of code with little effort. This whole concept is based on what happens in software land, with Visual Sudio, Eclipse and IntelliJ.</p><p>We don't have a booth, but we are still eager to meet with all of you. We'll be wearing Sigasi branded gear, so feel free to stop us and have a chat. </p><p>On Wednesday morning, 9:15, I will participate in the <a href="/content/sigasi-ready-21st-century">Lucio Litmus Test</a> panel which will ask us: "Are you ready for the 21st century?" With ten percent of the century gone, we sure hope so. </p><p>Right after the panel (Wed, 10:30), I invite everybody to come and talk to us in the Starbucks in front of the Anaheim Convention Center. I will share two things: The first (and perhaps most important) is  the load of <strong>Belgian Chocolates</strong> that are in my check-in luggage. The second is that we will offer you access to our online evaluation lab at <a href="http://www.xuropa.com" class="elf-external elf-icon">Xuropa</a>. This way you can experience the integration of Sigasi with Xilinx tools without installing anything on your computer. </p><p>If you're not at DAC, you will miss out on the chocolates, but feel free <a href="/start">try our Sigasi HDT tool</a> or <a href="mailto:philippe.faes@sigasi.com" class="elf-mailto elf-icon">contact me</a> to get invited to Xuropa.</p><p>-- Philippe</p>  </div>
