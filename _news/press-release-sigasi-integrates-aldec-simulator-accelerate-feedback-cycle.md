<p><em>Editorial Contact:</em><br/><em>Philippe Faes, <span class="caps">CEO</span> Sigasi</em>, <a href="mailto:philippe.faes@sigasi.com" class="elf-mailto elf-icon"><em>philippe.faes@sigasi.com</em></a><br/><em>Christina Toole, Marketing Manager Aldec</em>, <a href="mailto:christinat@aldec.com" class="elf-mailto elf-icon"><em>christinat@aldec.com</em></a></p>	<p><strong>San Jose, CA &#8211; May 22, 2012</strong> &#8211; Sigasi, a <span class="caps">VHDL</span> integrated development environment (<span class="caps">IDE</span>) provider, today announces the launch of a new version of its <span class="caps">VHDL</span> entry and inspection tool, Sigasi Pro 2.4. In response to user requests, this new version features integration with Riviera-<span class="caps">PRO</span> that enables users to automatically start the Aldec compiler with each file save. As a result, designers can see continuous, up-to date feedback from Riviera-<span class="caps">PRO</span>.</p>	<p>Correcting errors earlier in the process is, of course, a cost-saving effort in the long run. Sigasi&#8217;s type time compiler notifies the designer of certain common errors as the code is typed, however this type-time error checker does not catch all errors. The new integration with Riviera-<span class="caps">PRO</span> delivers a new line of defence against bugs and flags all violations of the <span class="caps">VHDL</span> language in the code &#8211; enabling users to continue to leverage <span class="caps">VHDL</span> while delivering access to alternative debugging features.</p>	<p>&#8220;Those errors would never make it to tape-out,&#8221; says Sigasi&#8217;s <span class="caps">CEO</span> Philippe Faes. &#8220;But they would take up precious time from design engineers and verification engineers.&#8221; The integration shortens the feedback cycle between man and machine (or between engineer and compiler). As a result, illegal <span class="caps">RTL</span> code will never survive longer than a few minutes, and will only take seconds to correct.</p>	<p>Interested hardware designers are invited to visit Sigasi&#8217;s website for a demonstration video: <a href="http://www.sigasi.com/aldec-integration">http://www.sigasi.com/aldec-integration</a></p>	<h3>About Sigasi:</h3>	<p>Sigasi is a privately held, Angel backed <span class="caps">EDA</span> company, making <span class="caps">VHDL</span> design easier, more efficient and fun.
