This method was not only time-consuming and error-prone, but also required significant disk space, <span class="caps">CPU</span> and memory on the user&#8217;s computer. Furthermore, the code development software lacked features for efficient, optimized design entry.</p>	<p>Using the Sigasi <span class="caps">VHDL</span> editor containing powerful features like type-time compilation, hardware designers can now find bugs, add functionality to existing projects and enable design reuse in a clearer, more user-friendly manner that greatly improves productivity. Integrated with the Plunify Cloud Compile&#8482; remote simulation and compilation platform, designers can then proceed seamlessly to test their designs. 256-bit <span class="caps">AES</span> encryption with asymmetric key pairs and <span class="caps">SSL</span> transmission technology ensure user data confidentiality. Especially at times of peak demand for design software and IT resources, designers can now securely offload simulation tasks to a dedicated data center, resulting in faster development cycles.</p>	<p>&#8220;This solution provided by Sigasi and Plunify greatly simplifies and speeds up the <span class="caps">VHDL</span> development process for our students and researchers,&#8221; said Dr. Akash Kumar, Assistant Professor, Department of Electrical Engineering, National University of Singapore.</p>	<p>&#8220;Plunify&#8217;s cloud computing features complements Sigasi&#8217;s platform well and makes it very easy for hardware designers to get started with their designs,&#8221; said Philippe Faes, <span class="caps">CEO</span> of Sigasi. &#8220;We are thrilled to provide this joint solution to the National University of Singapore.&#8221;</p>	<p>&#8220;With Sigasi&#8217;s unique code analysis and type-time error reporting, working together with Plunify&#8217;s secure and easy-to-use cloud simulation features, hardware developers get a much better design entry and simulation experience,&#8221; said Harnhua Ng, Director of Engineering at Plunify.</p>	<h3>About Plunify Pte.Ltd.</h3>	<p>Plunify&#174; cloud computing solutions enable semiconductor chip designers to shorten product time-to-market and reduce development costs with no disruption to existing workflows.
