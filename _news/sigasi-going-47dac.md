<p>Together with Sigasi&#8217;s CEO Philippe Faes, I will be attending the <a href="http://www.date-conference.com/" class="elf-external elf-icon">Design Automation Conference (DAC)</a> next month (June 13-15) in Anaheim. This conference is announced as:</p><p><cite>"DAC is the world&#8217;s leading technical conference and tradeshow, covering the latest trends in electronic design and design automation. DAC is where the IC Design and EDA ecosystem learns, networks, and does business &#8212; where critical industry issues are faced and solutions presented."</cite></p><p>This is something we just have to experience first hand. We hope it is different than what we experienced on the <a href="http://www.date-conference.com/date09/" class="elf-external elf-icon">Design, Automation &amp; Test Europe last year</a>:</p><p><span class="inline inline-center"><a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/4567/How-Marketers-Can-Overcome-Tradeshow-Depression-cartoon.aspx"><img src="http://www.sigasi.com/sites/www.sigasi.com/files/images/Hubspot-Tradeshow-Tyranny.gif" alt="Hubspot Tradeshow Cartoon" title="Hubspot Tradeshow Cartoon" class="image image-_original " width="517" height="640"/></a><span class="caption"><strong>Hubspot Tradeshow Cartoon</strong></span></span></p><p>We hope to meet a lot of interesting people face-to-face (and finally see the people behind the Twitter-accounts). We already have meetings planed with some EDA peers but we count on meeting many new contacts. We expect some deep discussions and valuable feedback on our ideas and vision.</p><p>If DAC results in a productive trip, we consider having our own booth at the exibition next year.</p><p>After DAC we travel to Silicon Valley for a three day visit. We expect more interesting discussions there. I also look forward to meeting an old friend and possibly a day of site-seeing in San Francisco.</p><p>If you are at DAC or around San Jose (June 16-18) and like to meet us, let me know (<a href="http://twitter.com/heeckhau" class="elf-external elf-icon">@heeckhau</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/sigasi" class="elf-external elf-icon">@sigasi</a>) so we can further improve our schedule.</p><p>Just hope we are not blocked by volcanic ash clouds.</p><p>Hendrik.</p><p>P.S.: DAC's Twitter hashtag is <a href="http://twitter.com/47DAC" class="elf-external elf-icon">#47DAC</a></p>  </div>
