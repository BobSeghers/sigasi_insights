<p><em>Editorial Contact:</em><br/><em>Philippe Faes, <span class="caps">CEO</span> Sigasi</em><br/><em>T: +32 9 265 71 38</em><br/><a href="mailto:philippe.faes@sigasi.com" class="elf-mailto elf-icon"><em>philippe.faes@sigasi.com</em></a></p>	<h3><span class="caps">VHDL</span> code inspection tool shows chip hierarchy, even for incomplete designs with errors</h3>	<p><strong>San Jose, CA / Ghent, Belgium &#8211; March 16, 2012</strong> Today, Sigasi announces a new release of its <span class="caps">VHDL</span> code comprehension tool and design entry tool. This release makes it easy to inspect legacy designs, even if these designs contain errors or if files are missing. Sigasi 2.3 Pro shows the hierarchy of a <span class="caps">VHDL</span> design, making it easy to inspect and navigate through legacy code. Even if the code contains syntax errors or missing declarations, the tool recovers and shows an outline of the chip hierarchy.</p>	<p>Add the hierarchy view to type-time <span class="caps">VHDL</span> code analysis and error reporting, and Sigasi becomes the most powerful <span class="caps">VHDL</span> code comprehension tool. With Sigasi, designers can start to understand large legacy hardware designs much faster. Even more importantly, designers can start adapting and reusing legacy code for their new designs.</p>	<p>Interested parties are invited to visit Sigasi&#8217;s website for a free evaluation license: <a href="http://www.sigasi.com">http://www.sigasi.com</a></p>  </div>
