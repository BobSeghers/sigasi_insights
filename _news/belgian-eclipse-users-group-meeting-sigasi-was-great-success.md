<p>Yesterday Sigasi hosted the <a href="/node/170">third Belgian Eclipse User Group meeting</a>. For the first time we reached a larger audience (I counted 23 attendees), so maybe we should have renamed it to the <em>first real</em> Belgian Eclipse User Group meeting...</p><p><span class="inline inline-center"><a href="/image/eclipse-users-group-meeting-sigasi-september-1st-2009"><img src="http://www.sigasi.com/sites/www.sigasi.com/files/images/IMG_2138.preview.JPG" alt="" title="" class="image image-preview " width="640" height="480"/></a></span></p><p>Everybody was well on time and eager to meet other <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Regional_Communities/Belgium" class="elf-external elf-icon">Belgian Eclipse users</a>. I received a lot of compliments for bringing us all together to exchange experiences.</p><p><span class="inline inline-center"><a href="/image/eclipse-users-group-meeting-sigasi-september-1st-2009-0"><img src="http://www.sigasi.com/sites/www.sigasi.com/files/images/IMG_2140.preview.JPG" alt="" title="" class="image image-preview " width="480" height="640"/></a></span></p><p>I started with a short introduction to present our (still a bit vague) mission and plans with this Users Group. I also took some time to have everybody introduce himself. Eclipse definitely has a very diverse user base.</p><p>Next I told Sigasi's story about how we are building <a href="/product">our product</a> on top of Eclipse. I saw a lot of confirming nods when I was relating about our difficulties and saw a lot of jealous faces when I bragged about our <a href="http://twitter.com/faes/status/2452586994" class="elf-external elf-icon">lava lamp alert system</a> for our regression test server.</p><p><span class="inline inline-center"><a href="/image/eclipse-users-group-meeting-sigasi-september-1st-2009-1"><img src="http://www.sigasi.com/sites/www.sigasi.com/files/images/IMG_2143.preview.JPG" alt="" title="" class="image image-preview " width="640" height="480"/></a></span></p><p>Next <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/vandepoel" class="elf-external elf-icon">Jan Van de Poel</a> introduced us the <a href="http://jazz.net/" class="elf-external elf-icon">Jazz development framework</a>. Ralph M&#252;ller couldn't resist expressing his disappointment in that Jazz is not <em>really</em> 'open'. Nevertheless everybody was impressed by the technology itself.</p><p><span class="inline inline-center"><a href="/image/eclipse-users-group-meeting-sigasi-september-1st-2009-2"><img src="http://www.sigasi.com/sites/www.sigasi.com/files/images/IMG_2147.preview.JPG" alt="" title="" class="image image-preview " width="480" height="640"/></a></span></p><p>Finally <a href="http://ralph-mueller.net/" class="elf-external elf-icon">Ralph</a> presented us his <em>random</em> thoughts about the Eclipse eco-system. I did not know Eclipse was so business driven.</p><p><span class="inline inline-center"><a href="/image/eclipse-users-group-meeting-sigasi-september-1st-2009-3"><img src="http://www.sigasi.com/sites/www.sigasi.com/files/images/IMG_2153.preview.JPG" alt="" title="" class="image image-preview " width="640" height="480"/></a></span></p><p>Afterward we had a few Belgian beers while we continued the discussion and talked about possible topics for future meetings. We definitely plan to organize a demo camp.</p><p><span class="inline inline-center"><a href="/image/eclipse-users-group-meeting-sigasi-september-1st-2009-4"><img src="http://www.sigasi.com/sites/www.sigasi.com/files/images/IMG_2154.preview.JPG" alt="" title="" class="image image-preview " width="640" height="480"/></a></span></p><p>I met a lot of new interesting people, but unfortunately the evening was too short to talk to everyone in person. So I look eagerly forward to our next meeting.</p><p>Thanks Damien (<a href="http://www.collibra.com" class="elf-external elf-icon">Collibra</a>) en Dieter (<a href="http://www.inventivedesigners.com/" class="elf-external elf-icon">Inventive Designers</a>) for co-organizing this event,<br/>Hendrik.</p>  </div>
