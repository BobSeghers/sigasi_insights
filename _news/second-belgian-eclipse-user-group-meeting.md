<p>Yesterday I drove to Antwerp for the <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Regional_Communities/Belgium" class="elf-external elf-icon">second Belgian Eclipse Community meeting</a>. The enthusiastic welcoming made me soon forget my traffic jam frustrations. While enjoying a few tasty sandwiches and exquisite wraps, I met a few new people.</p><p>Erik of Inventive Designers gave the first talk about his experiences with the new P2 update system for their <a href="http://www.inventivedesigners.com/scriptura" class="elf-external elf-icon">Scriptura tool</a>. It was interesting to hear how he had jumped through a lot of hoops to get the update system working. I'm glad we do not have to support so many different versions as they have. Nevertheless, I recognized a lot of Erik's frustrations with P2. </p><p>It was a nice interactive presentation. I should check out the development plan of P2 (<a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Equinox/p2/Plan" title="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Equinox/p2/Plan" class="elf-external elf-icon">http://wiki.eclipse.org/Equinox/p2/Plan</a>). And we should definitely also develop such a fancy installer as for Scriptura.</p><p>Next Stijn presented his experiences with the first beta release of <a href="http://collibra.com/products/" class="elf-external elf-icon">Collibra Studio</a>. It is interesting to hear how everybody encounters the same problems: How to streamline the build and release? How to profile an RCP application? What tools to use to write documentation?</p><p>After exchanging experiences with useful plug-ins and tools, we scheduled a next meeting. Without a message to the contrary, we meet again September 1st at our office in Gent. We also agreed that we should be present at <a href="http://devoxx.com/" class="elf-external elf-icon">Devoxx</a> later this year.</p><p>Thanks to Dieter and Erik for being such wonderful hosts.</p>  </div>
