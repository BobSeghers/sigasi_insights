<p>On Tue. Aug. 28. 2012, 14:00-18:00 Sigasi's <span class="caps">CEO</span> Philippe Faes hosts a tutorial on how to teach <span class="caps">VHDL</span> with Sigasi Pro. The tutorial takes place at the location of this year's <a href="/http://www.fpl2012.org"><span class="caps">FPL</span> conference</a> in Oslo, Norway.<br/>Please register by e-mail to <a href="mailto:university-program@sigasi.com" class="elf-mailto elf-icon">university-program@sigasi.com</a></p>	<p>This workshop introduces teachers to a new way of teaching hardware design. Students often find it difficult to master the <span class="caps">VHDL</span> language. While professors want to focus on teaching the concepts of digital design, students are often struggling with the syntax of the language. At the end of this course, you will be ready to start using Sigasi for your <span class="caps">VHDL</span> classes.</p>	<h2>Sigasi is proud to be a Silver Sponsor of <span class="caps">FPL</span> 2012</h2>  </div>
