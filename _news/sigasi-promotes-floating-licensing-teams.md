Customers can choose between user-locked or floating licensing at the same unit price.</p>	<p>Sigasi Pro is the most powerful <span class="caps">VHDL</span> <span class="caps">IDE</span> available. The unit price for a one-year Sigasi Pro license is $850 for customers in the US and Canada and &#8364;599 for customers in other countries. This license includes online support and regular updates.</p>	<p>Customers can choose to purchase user-locked licenses as before.  Alternatively, teams that purchase more than five licenses can opt for floating licenses at the same unit price. The license mechanism is based on the industry standard FlexNet, formerly known as FlexLM. This licensing scheme may reduce customers&#8217; administrative effort. Moreover, it allows any designer in the team to try out the fully functional product.</p>	<p>Other services and products, including premium support, perpetual licensing, or custom product features, are available upon request.</p>  </div>
