<p>There is no <span class="caps">VHDL</span> plugin for <a href="/windows.microsoft.com/IE">IE</a> or <a href="/www.google.com/chrome">Chrome</a>. Not because it is not possible, but because there is no reason. There are two important points we&#8217;d like to make on this April Fools day:</p>	<h2>No need for a single language</h2>	<p>People who are smart enough to learn <span class="caps">VHDL</span>, are smart enough to learn JavaScript or <span class="caps">PHP</span> too. Likewise, people who can learn C or Java, can learn <span class="caps">VHDL</span> or Verilog too. There is no need be monogamous when it comes to programming languages. All serious software engineers are fluent in at lease half a dozen languages, and have a working knowledge of a few dozen more languages. Learning languages is neither difficult nor essential. The essence is in the concepts behind the languages. Engineers choose a programming language because it supports concepts that they need: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming" class="elf-external elf-icon">procedural</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming" class="elf-external elf-icon">object oriented</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming" class="elf-external elf-icon">functional</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing" class="elf-external elf-icon">multi-threaded</a>). <span class="caps">VHDL</span> is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_typing" class="elf-external elf-icon">strongly typed</a>, procedural, massively multi-threaded language for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_event_simulation" class="elf-external elf-icon">discrete event simulation</a>, where threads communicate through an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_queue" class="elf-external elf-icon">event queue</a>.</p>	<h2><span class="caps">VHDL</span> is a programming language</h2>	<p>This brings us to the second point. As a procedural language, <span class="caps">VHDL</span> can be used for all your daily programming tasks. You could write a calendar application, a game of pong or a web server all in <span class="caps">VHDL</span>. All you would need is a good library for opening <span class="caps">TCP</span> sockets and perhaps a widget set so that you can draw directly on the user&#8217;s screen. In addition to being a programming language, <span class="caps">VHDL</span> (as Verilog) can also be translated to netlists of electronic gates and  can thus be used to create electronic circuits. It first intended use however, was to program a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_event_simulation" class="elf-external elf-icon">discrete event simulator</a>.</p>	<p>What is your opinion on this?</p>  </div>
