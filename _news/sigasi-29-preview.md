<p>The upcoming Sigasi 2.9 will contain a brand <strong>new scoping framework</strong>. This scoping framework is <strong>core functionality</strong> of Sigasi that links identifiers with the correct declaration. In the older versions, we had some problems with "overloadable" names and record element names. This made it very hard to fix certain bugs (such as <a href="http://www.sigasi.com/forum/generic-mapping-included-port-map-does-not-flag-error">ticket 1196</a> and <a href="http://www.sigasi.com/forum/false-error-report-vhdl-code-each-choice-can-be-specified-only-once">ticket 1650</a>). </p>	<p>As you know, any given declaration has a certain <em>scope</em>; it is visible in certain places of your code and not visible in other places. The scoping framework is responsible for figuring out where each declaration can be used. That seems easy, and in most cases (signals, constants, data types) it is. But there are some interesting corner cases that were not handled correctly in the older versions of Sigasi Pro. Some names can be reused many times in the same scope. You can declare several functions, procedures and enumeration literals with the same name in the same scoping region. This complicates things down the line. Also, for names of record elements and names of function parameters, the exact meaning of these names depends on where you use them. </p>	<p>The new scoping framework is a complete rewrite (<em>third time's a charm</em>) and we have worked hard to cover all cases. We've run tests on a lot of publicly available <span class="caps">VHDL</span> code, on code that our customers sent us and on special tests that we have created ourselves. Still, there is always a chance that we've missed something. Before we release our new scoping framework in the main product, we are now releasing a <strong>2.9 Preview Release</strong>. If you are working with a lot of functions, procedures, enumerated data types and records, this preview release is probably going to make you happy. Just download and try it out. Please <a href="mailto:support@sigasi.com" class="elf-mailto elf-icon">send us a note</a> if things work out, or if they don't. You help make this the best <span class="caps">VHDL</span> design tool in the market.</p>	<p>You can safely test this preview on your existing workspace.</p>	<p>Thanks,<br/>Hendrik.</p>	<h3>Stand-Alone download</h3>	<p><a href="http://download.sigasi.com/update/scoping-preview/com.sigasi.hdt.product-linux.gtk.x86_64.zip" class="elf-external elf-icon">Linux 64 bit</a><br/><a href="http://download.sigasi.com/update/scoping-preview/com.sigasi.hdt.product-linux.gtk.x86.zip" class="elf-external elf-icon">Linux 32 bit</a><br/><a href="http://download.sigasi.com/update/scoping-preview/com.sigasi.hdt.product-macosx.cocoa.x86_64.zip" class="elf-external elf-icon">Mac 64 bit</a><br/><a href="http://download.sigasi.com/update/scoping-preview/com.sigasi.hdt.product-win32.win32.x86_64.zip" class="elf-external elf-icon">Windows 64 bit</a><br/><a href="http://download.sigasi.com/update/scoping-preview/com.sigasi.hdt.product-win32.win32.x86.zip" class="elf-external elf-icon">Windows 32 bit</a></p>	<h3>Eclipse update site:</h3>	<p>http://download.sigasi.com/update/scoping-preview/eclipse-site</p>	<h3><span class="caps">RCP</span> update site:</h3>	<p>http://download.sigasi.com/update/scoping-preview/rcp-site</p>  </div>
