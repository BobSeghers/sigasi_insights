<p>Sigasi has been building on Eclipse since its earliest days. Today we have taken an extra step as we have been accepted as an <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/membership/showMember.php?member_id=990" class="elf-external elf-icon">Eclipse Solutions Member</a>.</p><p>We have long been convinced that a solid framework like <a href="/content/why-hardware-designers-should-switch-eclipse">Eclipse helps everybody</a>. The application developer can reuse a big portion of the Eclipse framework (<em>standing on the shoulders of giants</em>, so to speak). The end user has a single familiar user interface and can benefit from over a thousand Eclipse-based <a href="http://marketplace.eclipse.org/" class="elf-external elf-icon">solutions</a>.</p><p>As fresh Eclipse Members, we are proudly <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/membership/exploreMembership.php" class="elf-external elf-icon">listed</a> along some very interesting companies. We will make every effort to be worthy of this.</p><p><span class="inline inline-left"><img src="http://www.sigasi.com/sites/www.sigasi.com/files/images/eclipse_foundationmember.img_assist_custom-144x72.png" alt="" title="" class="image image-img_assist_custom-144x72 " width="143" height="72"/></span></p>  </div>
