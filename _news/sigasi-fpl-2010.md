<p>Do you remember when you were playing with your Lego? Do you remember you wanted to grow up to invent cool stuff? Did you imagine it would be as much fun as building a robot with Lego bricks? I did.</p><p>Today, when you are coding VHDL, do you get that same happy feeling inside? Most people don't. That's because stacking bricks is intuitive and coding VHDL is not. There's no good reason, though. With the right tools, VHDL can be as intuitive as productive and as much fun as stacking bricks.</p><p>If you're visiting <a href="http://conferenze.dei.polimi.it/FPL2010/" class="elf-external elf-icon">FPL</a> in Milan this year, come talk to me and I'll show you how. You'll get a set of Lego bricks just for showing up.</p><p>-- Philippe</p><p><span class="inline inline-center"><img src="http://www.sigasi.com/sites/www.sigasi.com/files/images/lego_sigasi.img_assist_custom-300x144.jpg" alt="" title="" class="image image-img_assist_custom-300x144 " width="300" height="144"/></span></p>  </div>
