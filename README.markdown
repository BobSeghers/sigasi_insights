## Authoring guide

### Images

* Images are stored in an `images` folder (e.g. /blog/images, /tech/images/, ...)
* Image file names must be **lower case**

Tips:
* Images can be aligned by appending `{: style="float:right"}` to the regular `![](images/...)` markdown syntax

### Code snippets

Tips:
* You can specify the language of code blocks by appending the language to the first three back ticks: e.g.
  ````` ```vhdl `````
