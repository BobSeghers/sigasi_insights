Sigasi has some Beta features that are not part of the main product.

To install the beta features, first make sure you have <a href="http://www.sigasi.com/download">installed Sigasi</a>.

* Then, click **Help > Install New Software...**
* Enter `http://download.sigasi.com/updates/labs2` as update site (confirm with enter)
* Select the Sigasi HDT 2.x Labs feature
* The other steps are straightforward!

If you need any help, or if you have questions or comments, [send-email].
