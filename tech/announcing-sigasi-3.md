Dear customer, we have just released the 3.0 version of our product, and renamed it to “Sigasi Studio”. Except for the new features, nothing changes for you:

* You get a **free upgrade** from Sigasi 2.x to Sigasi Studio 3.x
* Your **old license is valid** for Sigasi Studio until its original expiration date

We have defined new editions for Sigasi Studio (**Creator**, **XL** and **XL Doc** instead of the old Pro, Premium and Premium Doc). The [feature matrix](http://www.sigasi.com/products) has changed a little bit, but your old license will unlock all of the features that you were able to use in Sigasi 2.x.

The free Sigasi Studio **Starter** edition has now been optimized to work with minimal set-up.
Sigasi Studio Starter now works as a file editor, with the added power of navigation and code checking, rather than a project-based IDE.

Read the [release notes and update instructions](/releasenotes/sigasi-3.00.html)

For any questions, please contact your local distributor or contact Sigasi directly.
