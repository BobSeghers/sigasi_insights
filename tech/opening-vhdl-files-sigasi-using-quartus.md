<p>This page deals with step three of using the Quartus integration plugin for Sigasi. We assume you've gone through steps one and two:</p>	<ol><li>Installing the <a href="/content/install-sigasi-beta-features">Quartus integration plugin in Sigasi</a> (beta)</li>		<li><a href="/content/use-sigasi-default-vhdl-editor-altera-quartus-12.1">Setting Sigasi as default editor in Quartus II</a></li>	</ol><h2>How to open an <span class="caps">HDL</span> file in Quartus</h2>	<p>Step three happens when you open a <span class="caps">VHDL</span> file in Quartus, and Sigasi kicks in to show you the file. There are several ways to open an <span class="caps">HDL</span> file in Quartus. The most common ways are: , you can double-click a file in the Quartus project navigator, or double-click an error in the console log.</p>	<p><span class="inline inline-center"><img src="http://www.sigasi.com/sites/www.sigasi.com/files/images/open file in quartus.img_assist_custom-400x349.png" alt="Open a VHDL from Quartus" title="Open a VHDL from Quartus" class="image image-img_assist_custom-400x349 " width="400" height="348"/><span class="caption"><strong>Open a <span class="caps">VHDL</span> from Quartus</strong></span></span></p>	<p>Sigasi will now start and find a workspace (the place where al of your Sigasi metadata lives). You can use the default workspace and tell Sigasi to keep using the same workspace from now on.</p>	<p><span class="inline inline-center"><img src="http://www.sigasi.com/sites/www.sigasi.com/files/images/workspace-1.img_assist_custom-400x206.png" alt="Select workspace" title="Select workspace" class="image image-img_assist_custom-400x206 " width="400" height="206"/><span class="caption"><strong>Select workspace</strong></span></span></p>	<h2>First time Sigasi sees your Quartus project.</h2>	<p>When you double-click a <span class="caps">VHDL</span> file, Quartus (as of version 12.1) opens Sigasi and passes three bits of information: (1) the file (2) the line number and (3) the project. The first time you open a file in a given project, Sigasi needs to <em>import</em> your project.</p>	<p><span class="inline inline-center"><img src="http://www.sigasi.com/sites/www.sigasi.com/files/images/import quartus project.img_assist_custom-401x187.png" alt="Import Quartus project" title="Import Quartus project" class="image image-img_assist_custom-401x187 " width="401" height="187"/><span class="caption"><strong>Import Quartus project</strong></span></span></p>	<p>Also, the import wizard wants to know where Quatus is installed.</p>	<p><span class="inline inline-center"><img src="http://www.sigasi.com/sites/www.sigasi.com/files/images/quartus installation location.img_assist_custom-399x186.png" alt="Quartus installation location" title="Quartus installation location" class="image image-img_assist_custom-399x186 " width="399" height="186"/><span class="caption"><strong>Quartus installation location</strong></span></span></p>	<h2>The Quartus perspective</h2>	<p>Sigasi mirrors the Quartus project, and so these mirrored projects are not regular Sigasi projects. In fact, the look really messy and confusing in the regular Project Explorer. We have created a special "Quartus project view" to look at the mirrored Quartus projects in Sigasi. When you import a Quartus project in Sigasi, the import wizard will ask you if you want to switch to the Quartus perspective. So: yes, you do want to switch to the Quartus perspective.</p>	<p><span class="inline inline-center"><img src="http://www.sigasi.com/sites/www.sigasi.com/files/images/switch perspective.img_assist_custom-398x104.png" alt="Switch to Quartus perspective" title="Switch to Quartus perspective" class="image image-img_assist_custom-398x104 " width="398" height="104"/><span class="caption"><strong>Switch to Quartus perspective</strong></span></span></p>	<h2>Known issues:</h2>	<p>This is still a <strong>beta</strong> release, so we have some things that are not great yet. Please <a href="/forums/support-forum">let us know</a> what you like and what we should improve.	</p><ul><li>When you open a file in Quartus, the Sigasi window may not snap to the foreground and get the focus. Most operating systems don't allow windows to jump to the foreground as part of their malware protection. We're trying to figure out a way around this.</li>		<li>When you create a new file in Quartus (<strong>File &gt; New&#8230; &gt; <span class="caps">VHDL</span> File</strong>), Sigasi opens with a new file named <code>Vhdl1.vhd</code>, but the file is not added to the project.</li>	</ul>  </div>
