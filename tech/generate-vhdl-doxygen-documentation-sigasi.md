<p><em>I don't know any hardware developer who likes to document her design, but as far as I know everybody has to write documentation. Writing documentation is cumbersome. It often happens near then end of the project when stress and workload are already high. It easily gets out of sync with the design&#8230;</em></p>	<p><strong>Doxygen</strong> tries to make the documentation process easier. It extracts information from your <span class="caps">VHDL</span> source files to generate documentation. If you annotate your source files with <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/docblocks.html#vhdlblocks" class="elf-external elf-icon">special comments</a>, this documentation can give a nice extra view on your code. A large advantage is that there is only a <strong>single source</strong> for both your design and your  documentation. While this gives no guarantee for the design staying in sync with the documentation, it certainly makes it easier.</p>	<p>Although I am personally not that fond of Doxygen (but that is for another blog post). It is the only usable <span class="caps">VHDL</span> documentation system I have encountered so far.</p>	<p>Sigasi/Eclipse offers an easy way to get started and work with Doxygen. As a small example I generated <a href="http://www.sigasi.com/sites/www.sigasi.com/files/doxygen-example/index.html" target="_blank">Doxygen documentation for the tutorial project</a> that is shipped with Sigasi.</p>	<p><span class="inline inline-center"><a href="http://www.sigasi.com/sites/www.sigasi.com/files/doxygen-example/index.html"><img src="http://www.sigasi.com/sites/www.sigasi.com/files/images/DoxygenExample.preview.png" alt="" title="" class="image image-preview " width="640" height="479"/></a></span></p>	<h2>Install Doxygen and the Doxygen Eclipse plugin</h2>	<p>Before you can use the Doxygen plugin. You need to install  Doxygen itself on your system.</p>	<h3>Doxygen</h3>	<p>To install Doxygen on your system, visit <a href="http://www.doxygen.org" class="elf-external elf-icon">http://www.doxygen.org</a> and <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html#latestsrc" class="elf-external elf-icon">download the distribution for your system</a> or install it with your favorite package manager. You should also install <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/" class="elf-external elf-icon">dot</a> if you want nice looking graphs.</p>	<h3>Doxygen Eclipse plugin</h3>	<p><a href="http://home.gna.org/eclox" class="elf-external elf-icon">Eclox</a> is a simple Doxygen plug-in for Eclipse. It provides an graphical user interface to configure and run Doxygen. Eclox is available under the <span class="caps">GNU</span> General Public Licence (<span class="caps">GPL</span>).</p>	<p>Note that this plugin is no longer actively maintained. But I did not encounter any problems so it looks good enough to be useful.</p>	<p>To install the doxygen plugin:</p>	<p>1. Click <strong>Help &gt; Install New Software&#8230;</strong><br/>2. Enter <strong>http://download.gna.org/eclox/update/</strong> in the <strong>Work with</strong> field<br/>3. Select <strong>Eclox</strong><br/>4. <strong>Finish</strong> and <strong>Restart</strong></p>	<h2>Configuring Doxygen for your <span class="caps">VHDL</span> project</h2>	<p>Before  you can generate documentation with Doxygen, you need to create a Doxygen configuration file first. Once this file is properly configured, you are ready to generate nicely rendered documentation of your code.</p>	<h3>Create a Doxygen configuration file</h3>	<p>Once the plugin is installed, Sigasi has an extra @-button in the toolbar (If this button does not show up, click <strong>Window &gt; Reset perspective&#8230;</strong>). </p>	<p><span class="inline inline-center"><img src="http://www.sigasi.com/sites/www.sigasi.com/files/images/Doxygen1.png" alt="" title="" class="image image-_original " width="235" height="31"/></span></p>	<p>Click this button to generate a Doxygen configuration file. You can choose any filename you like, but the convention is to use <code>Doxyfile</code>. If you use this name, Sigasi will open this file with a rich editor. Although this editor is mainly targeted to C developers, it is also useful for <span class="caps">VHDL</span> designers.</p>	<p><span class="inline inline-center"><img src="http://www.sigasi.com/sites/www.sigasi.com/files/images/Doxygen2.png" alt="" title="" class="image image-_original " width="504" height="358"/></span></p>	<p>The basic settings, such as the project name,&#8230; you can configure in the basic tab. But most <span class="caps">VHDL</span> settings are only available in the advanced tab.</p>	<p><span class="inline inline-center"><img src="http://www.sigasi.com/sites/www.sigasi.com/files/images/Doxygen3.png" alt="" title="" class="image image-_original " width="529" height="621"/></span></p>	<p>I made following changes to the default settings:</p>	<ul><li><code>PROJECT_NAME = "Eclipse tutorial project"</code> to configure the project name</li>		<li><code>PROJECT_NUMBER = 1.0</code></li>		<li><code>OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_VHDL = YES</code> Configure Doxygen to tailor its output for <span class="caps">VHDL</span></li>		<li><code>EXTRACT_ALL = YES</code> Force Doxygen to create documentation for all your design files, even if the source files contain no special doxygen comments.</li>	</ul><p><em>Once you get to know Doxygen, it is easier to configure these settings in a regular text editor. You can do this by right-clicking the <code>Doxyfile</code> and selecting <strong>Open with &gt; Text Editor</strong>.</em></p>	<h3>Run doxygen</h3>	<p>To run Doxygen, simply press the @-button again. The generated files are written to the <code>doxygen-example</code> folder by default. Double-click the index.html file to see the results. The result will not have a lot of content in it. To add more content, you need to add special doxygen comments.</p>	<h3>Add doxygen comments to your design files</h3>	<p>To really document your source with Doxygen you need to add special <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/docblocks.html#vhdlblocks" class="elf-external elf-icon">code comments</a>.<br/>Instead of regular <span class="caps">VHDL</span> comments (<span class="geshifilter"><code class="vhdl geshifilter-vhdl"><span style="color: #3f7f5f;">-- &#8230;</span></code></span>), you have to use doxygen <span class="caps">VHDL</span> comments (<span class="geshifilter"><code class="vhdl geshifilter-vhdl"><span style="color: #3f7f5f;">--! &#8230;</span></code></span>). You have to place your comments in front of the item that you want to document. The only exception are ports and generics. You can document these with a a one-line description on the same line.</p>	<p>For more details consult the <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual.html" class="elf-external elf-icon">Doxygen manual</a> </p>	<h2>Useful links</h2>	<ul><li><a href="http://www.doxygen.org" class="elf-external elf-icon">Doxygen</a></li>		<li><a href="http://www.doxygen.org/manual.html" class="elf-external elf-icon">Doxygen manual</a></li>		<li><a href="http://home.gna.org/eclox" class="elf-external elf-icon">Eclox</a> : a simple doxygen frontend plug-in for eclipse</li>		<li>update site: http://download.gna.org/eclox/update</li>	</ul>  </div>
