<p><a href="/vhdl-lint">Sigasi Lint</a> performs static analysis for <span class="caps">VHDL</span> code in order to find <span class="caps">VHDL</span> code <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)" class="elf-external elf-icon">lint</a>. The built in <span class="caps">VHDL</span> linter will issue warning when you use certain suspicious <span class="caps">VHDL</span> constructions. While your code does not violate the <span class="caps">VHDL</span> syntax, there might be a problem with your code.</p>	<h2>"Others"</h2>	<p>The first lint check will flag a warning if you add <code>others</code> at the bottom of your case statement (with a state of enumeration type) when you don't really need it.<br/><span class="inline inline-center"><img src="http://www.sigasi.com/sites/www.sigasi.com/files/images/PreviewScreenSnapz001.png" alt="Redundant Others" title="Redundant Others" class="image image-_original " width="214" height="182"/><span class="caption"><strong>Redundant Others</strong></span></span></p>	<p>In <span class="caps">VHDL</span>, you need to cover all possible cases in a case statement. For a simple enumeration type, this is easy. For a <code>std_logic_vector</code>, you would usually omit all the meta-value (like <code>"UUUU"</code>) and cover these cases in the final choice: <code>others</code>.<br/>If you intend to cover all options (like in a state machine with an enumeration type) it is best to make this explicit, by not adding the unneeded <code>others</code>. Years from now, somebody might come along and change your code: add a state to the enumeration type or remove choices from your case statement. If they make a mistake, they will get an error message from their <span class="caps">VHDL</span> compiler. If you have added <code>others</code> to the end of your list, the <span class="caps">VHDL</span> compiler will accept the new (and probably incorrect) code of your colleague. That is why you don't want the <code>others</code> choice at the bottom of your case statement.</p>	<h2>Null range</h2>	<p>In <span class="caps">VHDL</span>, you can use ranges with <code>to</code> and <code>downto</code>. But, if you use the wrong direction, you get an empty range, which is usually not what you want: <code>7 downto 0</code> is a range of eight. <code>7 to 0</code> is an null range.<br/>We have a lint check that warns about this, even if you use constants (or some simple arithmetic).</p>	<p><span class="inline inline-center"><img src="http://www.sigasi.com/sites/www.sigasi.com/files/images/NullRange.png" alt="Null range" title="Null range" class="image image-_original " width="567" height="87"/><span class="caption"><strong>Null range</strong></span></span></p>	<h2>More lint rules</h2>	<p>There are more lint rules available, and we can implement your coding rules in Sigasi Lint for you. </p>	<p><a href="/vhdl-lint">Learn more about Sigasi Lint</a><br/></p>  <div id="book-navigation-1518" class="book-navigation">            <div class="page-links clear-block">              <a href="/content/deprecated-ieee-libraries" class="page-previous" title="Go to previous page">&#8249; Deprecated IEEE Libraries</a>                    <a href="/content/coding-conventions" class="page-up" title="Go to parent page">up</a>                    <a href="/content/dead-code" class="page-next" title="Go to next page">Dead code &#8250;</a>          </div>      </div>  </div>
