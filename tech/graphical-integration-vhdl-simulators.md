<p>This is a proposal for a thesis for Master of Engineering or Master of Science in Engineering students. In order to apply, please read the page on <a href="http://www.sigasi.com/internships">Internships and Thesis Proposals</a>.</p>	<ul><li>Project: Master of Science in Engineering thesis</li>		<li>Skills: Java, Eclipse</li>		<li>Target audience: electronics or computer science engineers</li>	</ul><p>You will create a plugin that provides the link between Sigasi Pro and ModelSim, the most popular <span class="caps">VHDL</span> simulator on the market. </p>	<p>When tools integrate with modelsim, the integration is usually limited to generation of makefiles and perhaps starting a compile operation or a simulation. Your mission is to build (a prototype of) a full integration with ModelSim, including:</p>	<ul><li><strong>Starting a simulation</strong> with a simple "play" button.</li>		<li>Processing <strong>error messages</strong>: if the simulator reports an error, this error should link back to the code that causes the error.</li>		<li><strong>Break points</strong>: click on lines of code to add or remove break points</li>		<li>Show <strong>signal values</strong>: hover over a signal name in the code to show its value during simulation</li>		<li><strong>Tcl interface</strong> so that the user can type commands for the simulator</li>	</ul><p>The result of your work will be a functioning prototype. Users will be able to start <span class="caps">VHDL</span> simulations in Sigasi/Eclipse, set breakpoints, step through code and debug <span class="caps">VHDL</span>.</p>  </div>
