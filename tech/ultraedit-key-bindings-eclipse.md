<div class="content">
<p>Sigasi has just released a new plugin for Eclipse: the <a href="https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/ultraedit-key-bindings" class="elf-external elf-icon">UltraEdit Key Bindings</a></p>	<p>It is a keyboard scheme (like the well-known Emacs keyboard schema) that mimics the keyboard bindings of the popular UltraEdit editor. The plugin is released under the <span class="caps">EPL</span> license and is <a href="https://github.com/sigasi/com.sigasi.ultraedit.bindings" class="elf-external elf-icon">hosted on GitHub</a>. We hope this plugin is useful for people who have previously used UltraEdit and have a hard time changing their habits.</p>	<p>Improvements are welcome as pull requests on the <a href="https://github.com/sigasi/com.sigasi.ultraedit.bindings" class="elf-external elf-icon">GitHub project page</a>.</p>  </div>
