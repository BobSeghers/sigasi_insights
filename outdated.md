Sigasi Starter Edition is free to use. In exchange for this, we ask that you enable [/manual/talkback] and that you keep your software up to date.
Any version that is more than 6 months old will stop working. We do this to ensure that everybody gets the latest features, and keep people from running 
in to any issues that have already been fixed.
