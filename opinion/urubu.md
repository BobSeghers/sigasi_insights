Since Sigasi's rebranding in January 2016, most content has been separated from the main Sigasi website. We now have a website hosted at
[insights.sigasi.com](http://insights.sigasi.com). This new Insights site contains the user manual, a collection of technological 
articles and an opinionated blog, among other sections. 

We decided on using [urubu_site] as CMS system for the Insights website. Urubu was created by Sigasi co-founder and VHDL guru [jandecaluwe]. 
Jan describes Urubu as "a micro CMS for static websites". We write all content in Markdown. The Urubu tool generates static HTML files and 
Github serves these static pages.

There are tons of advantages for us, like easy content writing and reviewing, website staging, easy theming. Just as important are the advantages
for you, the Sigasi Studio user, as compared to other CMS systems. 

First, Urubu allows [/tech/local_hosting].

The second advantage is that you can [add improvements][/todo_] to the documentation using the well known Github workflow of pull requests.
