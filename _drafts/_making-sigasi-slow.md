In this blog post I will learn you some tips and tricks on how you can make Sigasi pathetically slow. These tips can be extremely useful if your boss makes you evaluate Sigasi, and you want some easy excuses to avoid changes, and stick with Emacs or Notepad. Or imagine you have a hangover; a slow Sigasi could offer you some extra nap time.


Slow computer
Add memory like its 1999
Slow disk
Add lots of stuff to your project
Lots of HDL files
Very big HDL files
Lots of error markers
add an external compiler with lots of crazy compile flags (technically not Sigasi, but it will make Sigasi look like it is slow).
Install lots of extra plugins (preferably, exotic closed source plugins developped in 2002)
Replace the Java JVM with the oldest possible (but supported) version
Do not put fixed libraries in common libraries (run all checks)
