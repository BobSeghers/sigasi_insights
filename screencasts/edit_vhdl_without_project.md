You can edit VHDL files without setting up a project: just drag the files to the editor window. If you drag multiple files to the editor window, you can navigate from one file to the other using the "Open Declaration" feature. This makes editing VHDL files so much easier: no need to set up a project and you still get to use the best VHDL editor in the market.
