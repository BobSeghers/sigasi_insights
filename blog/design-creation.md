<p>Sigasi Pro helps electronics engineers to create their hardware designs faster and with less errors. </p>	<p>Writing <span class="caps">VHDL</span> is cumbersome and error prone. <span class="caps">VHDL</span> is extremely <strong>verbose</strong> (you need a lot of text to express even simple things) and <strong>pedantic</strong> (even small errors will cause compiler or run-time errors). These two characteristics unnecessarily add complexity to digital design. They raise the bar for junior engineers learning <span class="caps">VHDL</span> and they lock up mental energy of senior engineers working on large digital circuits.</p>	<p>Sigasi Pro takes the weight off your shoulders on those two fronts. Its differentiating features are:	</p><ul><li>type-time error checking,</li>		<li>tool-assisted quick-fixes,</li>		<li>code snippet generation, based on the context.</li>	</ul><h2>Dealing with <span class="caps">VHDL</span>'s pedantry</h2>	<p><span class="caps">VHDL</span>'s pedantic syntax checking and data type system were a design decision. The idea was that complaining early would reduce the risk of missiles going bananas in mid air. Remember that <span class="caps">VHDL</span> started as project of the US Department of Defense! Junior designers take many write / compile / fix iterations to get to code and senior designers lose precious time proofreading their code before hitting the compile button.</p>	<p><span class="inline inline-left"><img src="http://www.sigasi.com/sites/www.sigasi.com/files/images/write-inspect-fix.img_assist_custom-350x244.png" alt="Write-Inspect-Fix cycle" title="Write-Inspect-Fix cycle" class="image image-img_assist_custom-350x244 " width="350" height="244"/><span class="caption" style="width: 348px;"><strong>Write-Inspect-Fix cycle</strong></span></span> <span class="inline inline-right"><img src="http://www.sigasi.com/sites/www.sigasi.com/files/images/write-compile-fix.img_assist_custom-350x262.png" alt="Write-Compile-Fix cycle" title="Write-Compile-Fix cycle" class="image image-img_assist_custom-350x262 " width="350" height="244"/><span class="caption" style="width: 348px;"><strong>Write-Compile-Fix cycle</strong></span></span> <br/><br/><br/></p>	<p>Sigasi's solution to writing correct data is to shorten the feedback loop. As soon as an engineer types a few characters, the ultra-fast built-in <span class="caps">VHDL</span> parser kicks in. Much like a spell checker in word processos, Sigasi marks errors in the code only seconds after they arise. We call this <em>type-time</em> error checking.</p>	<p><span class="inline inline-center"><img src="http://www.sigasi.com/sites/www.sigasi.com/files/images/undeclared_signal_0.png" alt="Undeclared signal: error is marked as soon as the assignment is written" title="Undeclared signal: error is marked as soon as the assignment is written" class="image image-_original " width="254" height="34"/><span class="caption"><strong>Undeclared signal: error is marked as soon as the assignment is written</strong></span></span></p>	<p>The type-time compiler has to be very fast, so it does not perform a full analysis. In order to provide even more feedback about your code, Sigasi uses an external compiler for a full analysis. The external compiler is called as soon as you <em>save</em> the file, which is still a lot sooner than with a traditional flow.</p>	<p>Watch this <a href="/screencast/save-time-compilation-vhdl-code">video about catching errors</a> at type-time and save-time.</p>	<h2>Dealing with <span class="caps">VHDL</span>'s verbosity</h2>	<p><span class="caps">VHDL</span> needs a lot of words to express something. That doesn't mean that you have to type all of those words. As any decent editor, Sigasi comes with lots of templates for often-used constructs. Unlike other tools, Sigasi also generates code dynamically, based on the design context. With a few keystrokes, you can instantiate a component.</p>	<ul><li><strong>easily accessible templates</strong>: just a few key strokes</li>		<li><strong>dynamic templates</strong> use your design to generate code snippets</li>		<li><strong>quick-fixes</strong>: fix common errors in two clicks</li>	</ul><p>Watch <a href="/screencast/create-testbench-sigasis-autocomplete-feature">this short video about how to write a <span class="caps">VHDL</span> testbench</a> using static templates, dynamic templates for instantiations, and quick-fixes.</p>	<h2>Simply a great editor</h2>	<p>In addition to these super advanced features, Sigasi's editor is simply great. Based on the industry standard Eclipse platform, Sigasi's editor includes all standard features:</p>	<ul><li>block select a.k.a. column mode editing [<a href="/screencast/block-select">video</a>] [<a href="/doc/latest/editing#block-select">read more</a>]</li>		<li>code folding [<a href="/content/code-folding">read more</a>]</li>		<li>multi-screen support</li>		<li>configurable key bindings</li>		<li>and much more&#8230;</li>	</ul><p>And some not-so-standard features:</p>	<ul><li>Quick diff shows differences between the text on screen and the file on disk</li>		<li>Built-in local history to compare the file to the version of yesterday, 10:30.</li>		<li>Integration with all major version control systems</li>		<li>Bookmarks to keep track of line numbers in your files</li>		<li>and more&#8230;</li>	</ul>  <div id="book-navigation-1518" class="book-navigation">    <ul class="menu"><li class="leaf first last"><a href="/content/eclipse-keyboard-tricks-editing-code">Eclipse keyboard tricks: Editing code</a></li></ul>        <div class="page-links clear-block">              <a href="/content/work-not-vhdl-library" class="page-previous" title="Go to previous page">&#8249; WORK is not a VHDL Library</a>                    <a href="/knowledge-base" class="page-up" title="Go to parent page">up</a>                    <a href="/content/eclipse-keyboard-tricks-editing-code" class="page-next" title="Go to next page">Eclipse keyboard tricks: Editing code &#8250;</a>          </div>      </div>  </div>
