The LEON3/GRLIB project from <a href="http://www.gaisler.com">Airoflex Gaisler</a> (formerly Gaisler Research) is one of the largest <em>open source VHDL projects</em>. It contains almost 700 VHDL files, for a total of 600.000 lines of code. The project is based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Microcontroller_Bus_Architecture">AMBA</a> on-chip bus and serves as a framework for building <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_Chip">SoCs</a>. It is used in consumer electronics, automotive and aerospace applications.

LEON3/GRLIB can be intimidating at first. But once you get your feet wet, there is a lot to be learned. A lot more than from reading that book that's lying on your desk! 

Some interesting questions are: 
<ul>
<li>Should I use libraries? How can I organize them? 
<li>Can I make my code portable across different ASIC technologies and FPGA families?
<li>How do I configure different versions of my hardware design?
<li>How can I organize an on-chip bus structure?
<li>Which naming conventions could I use?
</ul>

In this webinar, Sigasi's founder and CEO, <em>Philippe Faes</em> will teach you how to navigate and understand complex hardware designs using Sigasi HDT. He will explain the basic structure of LEON3/GRLIB and point out the naming conventions used. 

This webinar is recommended for hardware designers and project managers working on SoCs or large digital designs. It starts on Wednesday, <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2010-02-17+15%3A00+Brussels">2010-02-17 at 15:00 CET</a> and it will take about 45 minutes.
