<p>In a small poll on the Sigasi website, 220 people responded to the question: <strong>Which editor do/did you use before you heard about Sigasi?</strong> We know that there is no reason to think that this test was representative of the entire VHDL development community, but the results are nevertheless interesting.  </p><p><span class="inline inline-right"><img src="http://www.sigasi.com/sites/www.sigasi.com/files/images/editors_poll.png" alt="VHDL Editors Survey Results" title="VHDL Editors Survey Results" class="image image-_original " width="300" height="296"/><span class="caption" style="width: 298px;"><strong>VHDL Editors Survey Results</strong></span></span>Unlike we had expected, the two ever present Unix editors, VI / VIm and Emacs / XEmacs (and their respective families) did not contest for the first place. In fact, the winner outran both VI and Emacs by far: <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/notepad-plus/" class="elf-external elf-icon">Notepad++</a> got 30% of the votes. VI and Emacs almost tied for the second and third place: 22% and 20% respectively. All three of the top most popular VHDL editors are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open_source_software" class="elf-external elf-icon">Free/Open Source software</a>.</p><p>Next in line were <a href="http://www.ultraedit.com/" class="elf-external elf-icon">UltraEdit</a>, with a mere 6%, the <a href="http://www.xilinx.com/tools/logic.htm" class="elf-external elf-icon">Xilinx ISE</a> editor (4%) and <a href="http://www.crimsoneditor.com/" class="elf-external elf-icon">Crimson</a> (4%). In the two-percent-or-less list we find the editors that come with the commercial EDA tools <a href="http://www.altera.com/products/software/quartus-ii/subscription-edition/qts-se-index.html" class="elf-external elf-icon">Quartus</a>, <a href="http://www.aldec.com/activehdl/" class="elf-external elf-icon">ActiveHDL</a> and <a href="http://www.mentor.com/products/fpga/hdl_design/hdl_designer_series/" class="elf-external elf-icon">HDL Designer</a>. Some free editors at the bottom of the list include <a href="http://www.jedit.org/" class="elf-external elf-icon">Jedit</a>, <a href="http://www.nedit.org/" class="elf-external elf-icon">Nedit</a> and <a href="http://www.kde.org/applications/utilities/kwrite/" class="elf-external elf-icon">Kwrite</a>. Some of the correspondents filled in <a href="http://www.nano-editor.org/" class="elf-external elf-icon">nano</a>, which we hope was a joke.</p><p>In conclusion, before they knew Sigasi, three quarters of our respondents uses free software for their VHDL editor. The 4-decade old editors VI and Emacs might have the most vocal following among VHDL designers, but Notepad++ is by far the most popular VHDL editor around. </p><p>If anybody knows of other surveys, that might be more accurate, we'd love to hear about them!</p>  </div>
