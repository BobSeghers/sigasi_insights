<p>It is no secret that Sigasi wants to <a href="http://www.sigasi.com/content/why-emacs-so-great-and-why-we-want-beat-it">take on Emacs</a> and the Emacs <span class="caps">VHDL</span> mode. I have posted <a href="/emacs">several articles</a> about the fundamental differences between Emacs and Sigasi. It usually boils down to the limitations of regular expressions and pattern matching. There are <a href="http://www.sigasi.com/content/syntax-errors-emacs-vs-sigasi">just</a> <a href="http://www.sigasi.com/content/code-coloring-emacs-vs-sigasi">certain</a> <a href="http://www.sigasi.com/content/rename-emacs-vs-sigasi">things</a> that require a parser rather than a simple pattern matcher.</p>	<h2>Code Formatter</h2>	<p>But we have to say that the <span class="caps">VHDL</span> Emacs mode has given us quite a bad time when it comes to beating the Emacs <span class="caps">VHDL</span> code formatter. For the longest time, we were almost ashamed of the quality of our code formatter in comparison with the Emacs <span class="caps">VHDL</span> formatter. <a href="http://www.sigasi.com/update_20110426">Just recently</a>, we have covered that issue too.</p>	<h2>What is still missing?</h2>	<p>There is an <a href="/faq/do-you-have-emacs-emulation-mode-so-i-can-use-emacs-key-bindings">Emacs emulator available</a> for Sigasi (and for Eclipse), so you can keep using your old key bindings. But there must be other things that you miss when switching from Emacs to Sigasi. Let's build a list of (relevant and technical) things that are missing from Sigasi <span class="caps">HDT</span>. All of your missing Emacs features are welcome in the comments section, below.</p>  <div id="book-navigation-1518" class="book-navigation">            <div class="page-links clear-block">              <a href="/content/vhdl-emacs-mode-navigation-using-ctags-are-broken" class="page-previous" title="Go to previous page">&#8249; VHDL Emacs mode navigation using ctags are broken</a>                    <a href="/better-emacs-vhdl-mode" class="page-up" title="Go to parent page">up</a>                    <a href="/content/sigasi-better-emacs" class="page-next" title="Go to next page">Sigasi Better than Emacs &#8250;</a>          </div>      </div>  </div>
