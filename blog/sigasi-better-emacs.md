<div class="content">
<p>Over the past few weeks, I have made an effort to demonstrate that Sigasi 2.0 is better than Emacs <span class="caps">VHDL</span> mode. I have also argued that Emacs <span class="caps">VHDL</span> mode used to be the best <span class="caps">VHDL</span> editor on the planet. In summary, I wrote about:</p>	<ul><li><a href="http://www.sigasi.com/content/why-emacs-so-great-and-why-we-want-beat-it">Why Emacs <span class="caps">VHDL</span> mode is so great</a>,</li>		<li><a href="http://www.sigasi.com/content/too-stupid-or-too-stubborn">Why engineers are smart enough to change editors</a>,</li>		<li><a href="http://www.sigasi.com/content/syntax-errors-emacs-vs-sigasi">Emacs has lousy error checking</a>,</li>		<li><a href="http://www.sigasi.com/content/libraries-emacs-vs-sigasi">Emacs does not support <span class="caps">VHDL</span> libraries</a>,</li>		<li><a href="http://www.sigasi.com/content/rename-emacs-vs-sigasi">Emacs does not support <span class="caps">VHDL</span> renames</a>,</li>		<li><a href="http://www.sigasi.com/content/code-coloring-emacs-vs-sigasi">Emacs' code coloring is outdated</a>,</li>		<li><a href="http://www.sigasi.com/content/navigating-through-vhdl-project-emacs-vs-sigasi"><span class="caps">CTAGS</span> and Emacs do a bad job at navigating through <span class="caps">VHDL</span> code</a>,</li>		<li><a href="http://www.sigasi.com/content/room-improvement">Which things are still lacking in Sigasi</a></li>	</ul><p>One of the most common comments I got was that Emacs is free. I know there is a bit of ambiguity in the word <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre" class="elf-external elf-icon">free</a>, but I get the feeling that most people are worried about their money. They don't want to pay for an <em>editor</em>. It seems hard for people to compare a <a href="/pricing">$840 tool</a>, with <a href="http://www.iis.ee.ethz.ch/~zimmi/emacs/vhdl-mode.html" class="elf-external elf-icon">one</a> that comes at a flat $0.00. </p>	<p>Tomorrow, we will launch the <a href="/sigasi-starter-edition">Sigasi 2.0 Starter Edition</a>. The <em>Starter Edition</em> will be free. Not just for a week or for a beta period, but forever.<br/>The Starter Edition is designed to be better than Emacs for any <span class="caps">VHDL</span> work you do. If your <span class="caps">VHDL</span> design is <em><a href="/faq/what-small-project">small</a></em> enough, you even get access to <em>all of the nice features</em> that paying customers will have. Stay tuned for more info.</p>  <div id="book-navigation-1518" class="book-navigation">            <div class="page-links clear-block">              <a href="/content/room-improvement" class="page-previous" title="Go to previous page">&#8249; Room for Improvement</a>                    <a href="/better-emacs-vhdl-mode" class="page-up" title="Go to parent page">up</a>                    <a href="/content/five-reasons-why-emacs-will-always-be-better" class="page-next" title="Go to next page">Five reasons why Emacs will always be better &#8250;</a>          </div>      </div>  </div>
