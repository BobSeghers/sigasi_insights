<p>Hardware designers hate integrated development environments (<span class="caps">IDE</span>s), and they have good reasons to do so. Most <span class="caps">EDA</span> vendors build <span class="caps">IDE</span>s that lock the user in. They force a workflow on the user, limit the number <span class="caps">EDA</span> tools that work with their <span class="caps">IDE</span>, and provide half-baked usability. The only way to fix this is to stop using <span class="caps">IDE</span>s that are built by <span class="caps">EDA</span> (electronic design automation) companies. Electronic design engineers should start learning and copying from their colleagues in software engineering.</p>	<p><a href="http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-blogs/other/4395992/Opinion--Why-IDEs-for-hardware-design-fail" class="elf-external elf-icon">Read the full story at EE Times</a></p>  </div>
