<p>Two weeks ago, we started a <a href="http://www.sigasi.com/node/887">survey</a> among our student users, about social media networks. Today, I'm presenting some of the results from this poll.</p><p>But first, we randomly picked a winner from the participants. Shafqat from the <a href="http://www.kth.se" class="elf-external elf-icon">Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden</a> will receive a BeMicro SDK development board, with an Altera Cyclone IV FPGA. Congrats, Shafqat and have fun!</p><p>So, on to the survey results. As usual, we don't claim any relevance whatsoever. To quote <a href="http://slashdot.org/pollBooth.pl" class="elf-external elf-icon">Slashdot</a>: "<em>This whole thing is wildly inaccurate. [...] If you're using these numbers to do anything important, you're insane.</em>" Don't you think that Mainstream Journalists should have disclaimers like this when they publish survey results or social science studies?</p><p><span class="inline inline-center"><img src="http://www.sigasi.com/sites/www.sigasi.com/files/images/socialMedia_0.img_assist_custom-319x203.png" alt="Popular Social Networks (size indicates importance)" title="Popular Social Networks (size indicates importance)" class="image image-img_assist_custom-319x203 " width="319" height="203"/><span class="caption"><strong>Popular Social Networks (size indicates importance)</strong></span></span><br/>That said, the winner is... <a href="http://on.fb.me/sigasi" class="elf-external elf-icon">Facebook</a>. What else is new? 80% of the participating students are on Facebook. About half uses <a href="http://www.LinkedIn.com" class="elf-external elf-icon">LinkedIn</a>, and less than 30% is on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/sigasi" class="elf-external elf-icon">Twitter</a>. In the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Tail" class="elf-external elf-icon">long tail</a>, there is one site that I was not aware of: <a href="http://www.studivz.net/" class="elf-external elf-icon">StudiVZ</a>, which claims to be Germany's biggest social network. Since we have many users and customers in Germany, it shouldn't be a surprize that StudiVZ shows up in our polls. </p><p>Social bookmarking is a lot less popular than social networking. Even the most popular social bookmarking site, <a href="http://www.StumbleUpon.com" class="elf-external elf-icon">StumbleUpon</a>, got less than a quarter of the votes. Ten percent go to <a href="http://www.delicious.com" class="elf-external elf-icon">Delicious</a> and <a href="http://www.digg.com" class="elf-external elf-icon">Digg</a> each.</p><p>As for the FPGA and VHDL related websites: Opencores gets frequent visits from almost 60% of the students. The Xilinx forum (49%) is almost double as popular as the Altera forum (25%). The other results are in the graph below.<br/><span class="inline inline-center"><img src="http://www.sigasi.com/sites/www.sigasi.com/files/images/fpga-vhdl-websites-students.img_assist_custom-479x337.png" alt="Popularity of FPGA and VHDL Related Websites" title="Popularity of FPGA and VHDL Related Websites" class="image image-img_assist_custom-479x337 " width="479" height="337"/><span class="caption"><strong>Popularity of FPGA and VHDL Related Websites</strong></span></span></p><p>Was that what you had expected, or did these results surprise you?
