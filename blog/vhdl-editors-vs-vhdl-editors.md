<h2>A (relatively) painless upgrade path for VI and Emacs users</h2><p>One editor is not as good as the next. Likewise, one VHDL editor is not as good as the next. In fact, even the word VHDL <em>editor</em> is not chosen correctly. You want to <em>design your hardware</em>, you don't want to <em>edit VHDL</em>. VHDL (or Verilog) is just a means to an end. </p><p>So you choose the best tool for the job: not an tool that pushes snippets of text around, but a tool that understands the VHDL code you type. Not an editor, but an Intelligent Development Environment (IDE). </p><p>What's in a name? -- An IDE by any other name should make you more productive.</p><p>So, you browse the web and finally find a VHDL development environment that understands your code. It helps you read old code. It helps you write new code. It's just great. <em>Except for one thing</em>. The big problem is that you are sooo used to your old key bindings. The new IDE just does not feel like <em>home</em>.</p><p>Today, the Eclipse community comes to your rescue. There are two plugins that emulate the behavior of two of the most popular VHDL editors on the planet: VI and Emacs (Yes, yes. That includes VIm, gVIM, Xemacs and the whole family.) Did I mention that these plugins work nicely together with the <a href="/install_plugin_36">Sigasi VHDL plugin</a>?</p><ul><li>VI addicts should try out <a href="http://vrapper.sourceforge.net/home/" class="elf-external elf-icon">vrapper</a>.</li><li>Emacs worshipers may want to look at <a href="http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/emacs" class="elf-external elf-icon">Emacs+</a></li></ul><p>Of course, there are other Emacs and VI emulators for Eclipse. Give them a shot and <a href="/comment/reply/790#comment-form">let us know what you think</a>!</p>  </div>
