<p>People <a href="http://www.google.be/search?q=hate+vhdl" class="elf-external elf-icon">hate VHDL</a>. People <a href="http://www.google.be/search?q=love+vhdl" class="elf-external elf-icon">love VHDL</a>. But most of all people love to complain about VHDL.<br/>I want to make a list of reasons to love or hate VHDL. Not to complain about them and not to prove that VHDL is better or worse than Verilog. No, I want to make this list so that we can use the strengths of VHDL, and find ways to overcome its weaknesses.</p><p>For all the Verilog guys reading this: I know Verilog deserves the same analysis. Since we do not have a Verilog product available today, I will save this discussion for later. In the meanwhile, please <a href="/keep-me-informed-about-verilog">give me a reason to put Verilog at the top of our priority list</a>.</p><h2>I Love VHDL Because</h2><ol><li>VHDL allows me to write a hardware design at a <strong>high level of abstraction</strong>.</li><li>VHDL is <strong>strongly typed</strong> so a large class of errors get flagged at compile time.</li><li>VHDL allows me to <strong>create new datatypes</strong>, so that I can write concise code.</li><li>VHDL has good mechanisms for <strong>code reuse</strong>, such as datatypes, functions, procedures and packages.</li></ol><h2>I Hate VHDL Because</h2><ol><li>The VHDL <strong>syntax is not consistent</strong>, and hard to remember.</li><li>The VHDL syntax is very <strong>verbose</strong>: you have to type a lot of words to get something done.</li><li>VHDL is pedantic in its requirements for <strong>type casting and conversions</strong>.</li><li>VHDL does not define a <strong>file and directory structure</strong>; everybody uses their own file structure.</li></ol><p>I have several more items for each list, but I am more interested in your reasons for loving and hating VHDL.<br/>Please let me know!</p>  </div>
