<div class="content">
<p>In VHDL, the concept of <em>libraries </em> is used to separate namespaces. The idea is that separate teams can develop code in their own library, without previously agreeing on naming conventions. Even if both teams implement an entity called <span class="geshifilter"><code class="vhdl geshifilter-vhdl"><span style="color: #7f0055; font-weight: bold;">memory</span></code></span>, they will still be able to use both implementations in a joint project. Assuming the two implementations are made by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acme_Corporation" class="elf-external elf-icon">Acme, corp.</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoyodyne" class="elf-external elf-icon">Yoyodyne, Inc.</a>, they may be instantiated as <span class="geshifilter"><code class="vhdl geshifilter-vhdl">acme.<span style="color: #7f0055; font-weight: bold;">memory</span><span style="color: #000000;">(</span>RTL<span style="color: #000000;">)</span></code></span> and <span class="geshifilter"><code class="vhdl geshifilter-vhdl">yoyodyne.<span style="color: #7f0055; font-weight: bold;">memory</span><span style="color: #000000;">(</span>RTL<span style="color: #000000;">)</span></code></span> respectively.</p><p>There is a <a href="http://www.velocityreviews.com/forums/t522692-use-of-libraries.html" class="elf-external elf-icon">some debate</a> about whether or not to use libraries in VHDL code. Especially sub-prime synthesis tools are known not to support VHDL libraries. A quick survey showed that today, most tools support libraries. Notorious exception is <a href="http://quartushelp.altera.com/9.1/mergedProjects/hdl/vhdl/vhdl_pro_libraries.htm" class="elf-external elf-icon">Quartus, which does not support libraries for entities</a>.</p><p>In the this blog post, I'm assuming that the benefits of VHDL libraries are established. If you disagree and you, nor your colleagues, nor your customers, nor your IP vendors, nor any companies you ever intend to acquire, <em>ever</em> use libraries at all, feel free to skip the rest of this article.</p><h2>Emacs</h2><p>The use of libraries is not supported in Emacs. From the <a href="/content/vhdles-mode-major-mode-editing-vhdl-code#makefile">documentation</a>:<br/><em><br/>Limitations: Only library units and dependencies within the <a href="/content/work-not-vhdl-library">current library</a> are considered.  Makefiles for designs that span multiple libraries are not (yet) supported.<br/></em></p><h2>Sigasi</h2><p>Sigasi HDT has supported libraries since the beginning. Since november 2009, Sigasi even offers the option to show the library name for each file in your project:<br/>To encourage the use of VHDL libraries to organize your projects. We now clearly mark each VHDL file and folder with the name of the library they belong to.<br/><span class="inline inline-center"><img src="http://www.sigasi.com/sites/www.sigasi.com/files/images/ProjectExplorerLibraryDecorator.png" alt="" title="" class="image image-_original " width="256" height="209"/></span></p><p>It is unlikely that Emacs users will use VHDL libraries. They are limiting themselves and their projects. As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument" class="elf-external elf-icon">Adam Maslow</a> could have said it: <em>If the only tool you have is a hammer, you're always going to shy away from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillips_screw" class="elf-external elf-icon">Phillips screws</a></em>.</p>  <div id="book-navigation-1518" class="book-navigation">            <div class="page-links clear-block">              <a href="/content/no-vhdl-rename-emacs-vhdl-mode" class="page-previous" title="Go to previous page">&#8249; No VHDL Rename in Emacs VHDL mode</a>                    <a href="/better-emacs-vhdl-mode" class="page-up" title="Go to parent page">up</a>                    <a href="/content/emacs-code-coloring-outdated" class="page-next" title="Go to next page">Emacs Code Coloring is Outdated &#8250;</a>          </div>      </div>  </div>
