Since Sigasi is built on Eclipse, you can install third party Eclipse
plugins.

The best place to start looking for a plugin is the [Eclipse
Marketplace](http://marketplace.eclipse.org). We list some interesting
plugins here. Since these are third party plugins, there is no official
support from Sigasi.

Revision Control Systems
========================

Sigasi supports a wide range of [Revision Control
Systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control) (also know as
Version Control or Source Control systems). Support for revision control
is based on Eclipse plugins. This chapter contains a preliminary listing
of the most popular revision control systems.

GIT {#revision-git}
---

Recommended plugin: [EGit](http://www.eclipse.org/egit/)\
This plugin is shipped with the standalone version of Sigasi.

Subversion (SVN) {#revision-svn}
----------------

Recommended plugin: [Subversive](http://www.eclipse.org/subversive/)

ClearCase {#revision-clearcase}
---------

Recommended plugin:
[ClearCase](http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/eclipse-ccase/index.php?title=Main_Page)
(Update site: http://eclipse-ccase.sourceforge.net/update/ )

Note that this is the **Open Source ClearCase plugin** hosted on
SourceForge, not the [**official** ClearCase plugin distributed by
IBM](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/downloads/07/cc_eclipse3_2/clearcase_plugins.html)
.

Local history {#revision-local}

While this is not strictly speaking a version control system, Sigasi has
a built-in feature that keeps a local history of your files. \
