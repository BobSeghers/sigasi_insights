Sigasi has an automated update system. When updates are available, you are notified by a pop-up window called *Updates Available* in the bottom right corner:

![Updates](/images/screenshots/update.png)

If you want to install the updates, click anywhere in the pop-up window. After a few seconds, a new window will appear with further instructions.

The updates can be postponed by closing the pop-up. You can perform the updates at any time by clicking the !(inline)./images/icons/updatesAvailableIcon.png!-icon in the status bar at the bottom of the screen.

Consult the [troubleshooting] chapter if the update does not start automatically.
