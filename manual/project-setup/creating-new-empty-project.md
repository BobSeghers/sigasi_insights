To create a new project, select *File > New > Empty VHDL Project* or *File > New > Empty Verilog Project*. Then give your project a name.

By default, the *Use default location* checkbox is checked, which means that new projects will be located in the workspace folder. Alternatively, you can uncheck the checkbox and choose an arbitrary location for your project. This is especially useful if you want to _use Sigasi with an existing design_. 

After creating a new project, you can add existing files by dragging them from your filesystem into the project explorer. New files can be added by clicking *File > New > VHDL file* or *File > New > Verilog file*.
