1: Import the project
==================

You can import an existing VHDL project from the file system by clicking **File > Import... > Sigasi > Import a VHDL project**. Browse to the root directory of the project, and press **Finish**.

2: Set Libraries
================

If you use other libraries than just work, you can assign different libraries to your files and folders. Right-click on a file or folder and select **Library Mapping > New Library...**. Then fill out the correct library name.

3: Add any files that are in other directories
==============================================

If you need additional files that are not in the project root directory, just drag them from your Windows Explorer (or other file browser) into the project. You will have the option to create a link rather than copying the files.

**Note:** dragging files works on Windows (using Windows Explorer), on Mac OS X (using Finder) and on Linux (using Gnome Nautilus). If you use KDE, you should install Nautilus.
