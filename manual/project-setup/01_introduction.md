Your work with Sigasi typically is organized as a _project_. A project is a collection of VHDL or Verilog files that belong together. Sigasi understands the HDL units defined in the files, and the relationships between them.

Your first step is to set up a project. There are a number of ways to do this. The most common ways are:

* [creating-new-empty-project]
* [importing-project-file-system]

These two methods and other methods are discussed in detail in the following sections.


Other ways to set up a project
==============================

Importing a project from an archive
-----------------------------------

Sigasi projects can be shared using file archives. All project-related settings are stored in two hidden files in the project folder. Therefore, you can create an archive of the entire top level folder (*File  > Export > General > Archive file*) and send it to someone else.

You can import a project from an archive by clicking *File > Import... > General > Existing projects into Workspace*, and selecting *Select archive file*. Browse to your project archive, and press *Finish*.
