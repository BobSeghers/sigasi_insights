You can add also add VHDL or Verilog project to any project in your workspace by right-clicking the project in the project explorer and selecting *Configure > Add VHDL support* or *Configure > Add Verilog support*. You can also remove VHDL or Verilog support from Sigasi projects by selecting *Configure > Remove VHDL support* or *Configure > Remove Verilog support*.  

Note that a only with a Sigasi Premium license, you can have VHDL and Verilog support at the same time.

With other licenses (Sigasi Pro), a project can contain both VHDL and Verilog files, but only one of the languages will have full support. Files in the other language will be handled in "single file mode":/manual/opening_files#files-external .
