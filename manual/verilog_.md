In addition to the powerful features of an Eclipse editor, the Verilog
editor that comes with Sigasi supports a number of advanced editing
features which are specifically useful for Verilog editing. These are
described in this chapter.

# Smart Indentation {#smartindent}

When you press enter, Sigasi automatically adjusts the indentation of
current and the new line. Depending on the content of the preceding
line, Sigasi will automatically increase or decrease the indentation
level. E.g. an extra indent after a `module` and remove an indent for
the matching `endmodule`.

You can enable/disable this feature via **Window \> Preferences \>
Sigasi \> Verilog** by toggling the **“Enter adjusts indentation on
current and next line”** setting.

**Tabs vs. spaces:** This features inserts tabs characters or spaces,
according to your preferences.
