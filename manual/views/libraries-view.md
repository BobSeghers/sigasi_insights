Description
===========

The libraries view shows the library mapping of the design units in all projects. You can use it to navigate to a particular design unit in your project. When you double click on a file, the file opens in the Editor view. If you right-click a file, you see the _context menu_ which offers extra commands for "library mapping":libraries#libraries-mapping .

If you enable the **Link with Editor** button ![Link](/images/icons/linkProjectExplorer.png) , the Library view will be linked to the [editor-view]. Now, the active file in the editor view will always be selected in the Library view.
