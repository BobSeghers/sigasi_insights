The VHDL perspective
=====================

Sigasi is built upon the Eclipse platform, which permits to use multiple languages within a single environment. The user interface can be customized for a particular language. In Eclipse terminology, this customized user interface is called a _perspective_. The logo of the current perspective is higlighted in the upper right corner. The recommended perspective  to use with Sigasi (for both VHDL and Verilog)  is the _VHDL perspective_, with the following logo:

If you use the standalone version, this is the default perspective. If you use the Eclipse plugin, another perspective may be open instead. You can select the VHDL perspective by clicking the button !(inline)./images/icons/perspectiveButton.png! next the perspective logo. A window pops up in which you can select the perspective:
