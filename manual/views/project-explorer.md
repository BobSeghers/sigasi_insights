Description
===========

This view shows the directory structure of all files in all projects. You can use it to navigate to a particular file in your project and select it. When you double click on a file, the file opens in the Editor view. If you right-click a file, you see the _context menu_ which offers extra commands.

Customize
=========

You can customize the behavior of the Project Explorer View in ways that can be particularly handy for large projects. For example, if you click the **Link with Editor** icon ![Link](/images/icons/linkProjectExplorer.png) , the Project Explorer will be linked to the Editor view. Now, the active file in the editor view will always be selected in the Project Explorer.

You can apply filters to choose which files are shown. Select the icon **View Menu** ![View Menu](/images/icons/viewMenuIcon.png) and then **Customize view**. You can then select a filter whose matching files will be hidden in the view. For example, you can filter out all non-VHDL or non-Verilog files.
