        <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>HDL libraries are a very powerful feature of the HDL languages. Sigasi
makes it easy to configure and use them. In this chapter, we assume that
the basic concepts of VHDL libraries are understood. We will explain how
they are implemented in Sigasi.</p>
<p>Like with any HDL tool, Sigasi needs to know where the libraries are
located on the file system. We will describe how the library
configuration can be examined and modified using the GUI.</p>
<p>We will also present some use case about how to set up libraries with
Sigasi HDT to organize your projects.</p>
<h3 id="libraries-examine">Examining the library configuration</h3>
<p>You can examine the library configuration in the <a href="/manual/libraries-view">Libraries
view</a> and in the <a href="/manual/project-explorer">Project
Explorer</a> view. The Libraries view shows how
<em>design units</em> are mapped. The Project Explorer view show how VHDL or
Verilog <em>files</em> are mapped.</p>
<p>In the Libraries view you can see a tree of all libraries in your
projects. You can open each library to see all contained design units.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/images/screenshots/LibrariesView.png" /></p>
<p>In the Project Explorer view each physical file or folder is annotated
with the library it belongs to, between square brackets:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/images/screenshots/LibraryMappingInitialView.png" /></p>
<p>What you see here is the initial library mapping of a demo project (you
can create such a project by selecting <strong>File > New > Other > Demo
Vhdl project</strong>). We see a project called Demo, with a folder named
<code>Common Libraries</code>. In that folder, you see the typical standard
libraries (<code>std</code> and <code>ieee</code>) upon which all VHDL projects depend. The
demo project itself consists of a few VHDL files.</p>
<p>Next to the project’s name, <code>Demo</code>, is the annotation <code>work</code>. This means
that, barring any overrides, everything in the project will be stored
inside the <code>work</code> library.</p>
<p>Lower down, we see overrides. For example, the <code>STD</code> folder has an
annotation <code>std</code>. This means that, again barring any further overrides,
the entire contents of the <code>STD</code> folder will be mapped into the library
<code>std</code>. There are no limits to the number of overrides that can be
performed. If this needed, any individual file can be mapped to a
separate library.</p>
<h3 id="libraries-mapping">Modifying the library configuration</h3>
<p>The library mapping for project files can be modified in the Libraries
and Project Explorer view.</p>
<p>Select a file or a folder in the Project Explorer and right-click.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/images/screenshots/LibraryMappingContextMenu.png" /></p>
<p>You get a <code>Library Mapping</code> context menu, with a a number of options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the name of an existing library to map the file or folder to
    that library</li>
<li>Select <strong>Unmap</strong> to exclude the file or folder from any library</li>
<li>Select <strong>New Library</strong> to define a new library and map the file or
    folder to it</li>
</ul>
<p>When you map a file into a library, only that file is affected. However,
when you map a folder into a library, then everything in that folder
will be mapped into that library. Any overrides in the folder and its
sub-folders will be removed. When you are defining the library mapping
for a new project you should map from top to bottom.</p>
<p>So in the case of our <code>Demo</code> project, you would change (if <code>work</code> is not
a good default) the top folder’s mapping first and then override the
mapping in the sub-folders.</p>
<p>When you are changing the library mapping of a project, the project will
be rebuilt completely. In order to <em>avoid several consecutive rebuilds</em>
while you are setting up your libraries, you can temporarily disable the
automatic rebuilds, until you are finished setting up your library
mappings. You can do this by disabling the <strong>Project > Build
Automatically</strong> option.</p>
<p>To exclude a file from all libraries, the library mapping context menu
provides an <code>Unmap</code> option. You can apply that to any file or folder in
the project. Sigasi will then assume that the corresponding resource is
not a part of the project and will not include that resource in a
project build. This is typically useful when you have stale copies of
HDL files or folders lying around that you want simply to be ignored.</p>
<h3 id="libraries-common">Common libraries</h3>
<p>In any newly created VHDL project, the <code>Common Libraries</code> folder
contains the VHDL files of the <code>IEEE</code> and <code>STD</code> libraries. This folder
is special in the sense that its contents is not stored in regular files
on your hard drive. Instead, the files’ contents is shipped as part of
the Sigasi installation. Other than that, the <code>Common Libraries</code> folder
behaves like any other folder. You can delete it, rename it, and apply a
different library mapping. In most cases, however, the default
configuration is just what you need.</p>
<p>If you have modified the <code>Common Libraries</code> folder, you can always
revert it back to the original state.
Right-click on your project in the explorer view and apply menu-entry
<strong>Reset Library Mapping</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/images/screenshots/LibraryMappingRestoreCommonLibraries.png" /></p>
<h3 id="shared-libraries">Shared libraries</h3>
<p>Sigasi allows you to share libraries between multiple projects. The
easiest way to do this, is to develop each library in a separate project
and configure the <strong>Project Dependencies</strong> accordingly. To configure the
project dependencies, right click the project (the one that uses the
shared library) and select <strong>Properties</strong>. Next click <strong>Project
References</strong> and mark the library project as referenced project.</p>

<h3 id="libraries-third-party">Using third party libraries</h3>
<p>Many projects use third party libraries. These can be added to the
project as any other set of VHDL files.</p>
<p>A number of popular third party libraries are the following:</p>
<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Vendor</th>
<th>Library</th>
<th>Install dir example</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Xilinx</td>
<td><code>unisim</code></td>
<td><code>C:\Xilinx\14.4\ISE_DS\ISE\vhdl\src\unisims</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Xilinx</td>
<td><code>XilinxCoreLib</code></td>
<td><code>C:\Xilinx\14.4\ISE_DS\ISE\vhdl\src\XilinxCoreLib</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Xilinx</td>
<td><code>simprim</code></td>
<td><code>C:\Xilinx\14.4\ISE_DS\ISE\vhdl\src\simprims</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Altera</td>
<td><code>altera_mf</code></td>
<td><code>C:\altera\12.1\quartus\libraries\vhdl</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mentor</td>
<td><code>modelsim_lib</code></td>
<td><code>${ModelSimPath}\vhdl_src\modelsim_lib</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>On Linux the default installation location for Xilinx is <code>/opt/Xilinx</code>
and <code>/opt/altera</code> for Altera.</p>
<p>For many common third party libraries, you can set up the library using
a <a href="/manual/quickfix-third-party-libraries">Quickfix</a>.</p>
<h3 id="library-errors-from-external-compilers">Library errors from external compilers</h3>
<p>If you are using the <a href="/manual/external-compiler-integration">external compiler
integration</a>, the external
compiler can also put error markers on library clauses. You can easily
verify this by checking the prefix of the error message (e.g. <code>vcom:</code>
for vcom errors). Consult the <a href="/manual/external-compiler-integration#integration-external-compiler-libraries">libraries section of the external
compiler
integration</a>
for more information on configuring libraries for your external
compiler.</p>
